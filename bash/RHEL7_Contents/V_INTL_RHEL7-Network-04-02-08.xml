  <Title>Enable TCP SYN Cookies  </Title>
  <Description>When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the 
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN 
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the 
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that 
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet 
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake 
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has 
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no 
corresponding SYN in the queue.
