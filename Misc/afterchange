Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download.

Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines.

Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v.

An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.


Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.


Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:Office v. X contains a network-aware anti-piracy mechanism that detects multiple copies of Office using the same product identifier (PID) running on the local network. This feature, called the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker, announces Office&#8217;s own unique product ID and listens for other announcements at regular intervals. If a duplicate PID is detected, Office shuts down. A security vulnerability results because of a flaw in the Network PID Checker. Specifically, the Network PID Checker doesn&#8217;t correctly handle a particular type of malformed announcement &#8211; receiving one causes the Network PID Checker to fail. When the Network PID fails like this, the Office v. X application will fail as well. If more than one Office v. X application was running when the packet was received, the first application launched during the session would fail. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause other users&#8217; Office applications to fail, with the loss of any unsaved data. An attacker could craft and send this packet to a victim's machine directly, by using the machine's IP address. Or, he could send this same directive to a broadcast and multicast domain and attack all affected machines. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.


Description:The IETF Profile of the X.509 certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate. One of these is the Basic Constraints field, which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate&#8217;s chain and whether the certificate is a Certificate Authority or an end-entity certificate. However, the APIs within CryptoAPI that construct and validate certificate chains (CertGetCertificateChain(), CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(), and WinVerifyTrust()) do not check the Basic Constraints field. The same flaw, unrelated to CryptoAPI, is also present in several Microsoft products for Macintosh. Some vendors implement a policy of only providing the latest versions of their software for download. The associated executable for this vulnerability definition is no longer available from the vendor and as such cannot be downloaded via LANDESK Security and Patch Manager.

Description:Sometimes when administrators delete users from the system they neglect to remove all files owned by those users from the system. A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up "owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended. It is a good idea to locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files, and make sure to reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system (in this example, &#8220;bin&#8221;) as appropriate

Description:The stock /etc/inetd.conf file shipped with HP-UX contains many services which are rarely used, or which have more secure alternatives. Indeed, after enabling SSH , it may be possible to completely do away with all inetd-based services, since SSH 
provides both a secure login mechanism and a means of transferring files to and from the system. The steps articulated in the Remediation section will disable all services normally 
enabled in the HP-UX inetd.conf file.
