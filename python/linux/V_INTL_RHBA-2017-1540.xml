  <Title>openstack-neutron bug fix advisory</Title>
  <Description>
        
Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides the facilities for building a private
or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud running on commonly
available physical hardware. This advisory includes packages for:
 OpenStack Networking service
OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a virtual network service for OpenStack.
Just as OpenStack Compute (nova) provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual servers, OpenStack Networking provides an API to
dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks connect
'interfaces' from other OpenStack services (e.g. virtual NICs from Compute
VMs).  The OpenStack Networking API supports extensions to provide advanced
network capabilities (e.g. QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)
This update addresses the following issues:
 Previously, python-neutron did not convert some errors into expected exception types. As a result, it was possible for users to get unexpected exceptions based on those errors. With this update, all errors are now captured, even if the server side does not return a correct exception message. This helps ensure consistent behaviour from the library in case of errors. (BZ#1385084)
 Previously, the default L3 HA implementation (keepalived) sometimes flipped the master router instance to `backup` if it received multiple SIGHUP signals in quick succession. Consequently, L3 connectivity was disrupted until the previous backup keepalived instance took over.
With this update, to work around this keepalived behavior, the neutron L3 agent now throttles SIGHUP signals sent to keepalived to make sure keepalived has enough time to reload configuration without being disrupted by failovers.
As a result, L3 connectivity implemented using HA routers is not disrupted after router updates arriving in quick succession (for example, with floating IP updates). (BZ#1371948)
 With this enhancement, L3 HA failover is not dependent on neutron components. This update also reduces HA failover time, as there is no dependency on neutron to create any OVS flows during failover. (BZ#1395532)
 There is a known issue when both `l2pop` and `arp_responder` are enabled for the linuxbridge agent: the instance will fail to communicate with the router. The temporary workaround is to set `arp_responder=false`. This issue only occurs with the linuxbridge agent; the OVS agent is not affected. (BZ#1395532)
 Previously, because of the way the initial sync was done after starting the DHCP agent, periodic reports were not sent until the sync completed.  In large environments this can be a lengthy process, and the lack of status reports during this process caused the agent to be marked as DOWN. This fix allows periodic reports to be sent during the DHCP agent initial sync, so it won't be marked as DOWN.  It also addresses a bug which caused the initial sync to be performed twice, so the setup time has been halved. (BZ#1433256)
        Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
