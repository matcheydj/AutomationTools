  <Title>lorax bug fix and enhancement update</Title>
  <Description>
        
Lorax is a tool for creating the anaconda install images. It also includes
livemedia-creator which is used to create bootable livemedia, including live
isos and disk images. It can use libvirtd for the install, or Anaconda's image
install feature. 
Bug fixes:
 Previously, the plymouth dracut module was excluded from the IBM Power Systems
initrd and upgrade.img images because the initrd daemon was exceeding the 32MiB
limit. As a consequence, upgrades on the aforementioned platform did not work
correctly. This update allows the plymouth dracut module to be added to
upgrades.img, which has no size limit like initrd, and upgrades on IBM Power
Systems now work correctly. (BZ#1069671)
 Booting from DVD on IBM System z requires kernel arguments that were
previously missing, which caused that the IBM System z was not able to boot from
DVD. A new rpm file has been added with DVD specific commands in it to fix this
bug, and IBM System z now boots from DVD successfully. (BZ#1132050) 
 Prior to this update, the petitboot bootloader could not parse certain aspects
of grub2.cfg files. As a consequence, petitboot did not boot DVD media. The
32-bit section has been deleted from grub2.cfg, and petitboot can now boot the
DVD media successfully. (BZ#1169878) 
 Previously, the 64-bit ARM architecture lorax template did not include the
boot.iso creation section, which caused that the boot.iso image was not created.
This update adds the mkisofs command to the template, and the boot.iso is now
created by lorax as expected. (BZ#1174475) 
 When running the lorax utility in non-English locales, the yum action string
could cause a traceback error. Consequently, running lorax on different locales
failed. This update makes sure that the yum action string is UTF-8 encoded
before printing it, and lorax can now be used in other locales. (BZ#1072362) 
 As BOOTAARCH64.efi is not a File Allocation Table (FAT) compliant file name,
the installation could not boot on all UEFI implementations. To fix this bug,
the name has been changed to BOOTAA64.efi, which is compatible with all UEFI
implementations, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1080113) 
Enhancements:
 With this update, the image-minimizer tool is available to be used with the
livemedia-creator utility and other projects using the kickstart installation
method. (BZ#1082642) 
 IBM Power Systems support has been added to the livemedia-creator utility, so
that live media, such as ISO or disk images, can be built on this platform.
(BZ#1102318) 
 The od, hexdump, and hexedit utilities have been added to lorax as well as all
the binaries from sg3_utils. In addition, rescue mode is more useful for system
examination and repair as the xfsdump and xfsrestore utilities are now also
available. (BZ#1109785) 
 With this update, the kdump anaconda addon is included in the installation
media to make the kdump utility available for use and configuration in anaconda.
(BZ#1116335) 
 The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) kernel drivers and
impitools have now been included in the installation media to support the
ability of anaconda to log the installation state using IPMI. (BZ#1126009)
 Support for the livemedia-creator utility has been added to help in creating
Docker images. The support includes the addition of "--make-fsimage" option to
the virt-install utility and the "--make-tar" option, which creates a xz
compressed tarfiles of the root file system. (BZ#1144140) 
 To be consistent with other architectures and to be able to boot initrd images
larger than 32MiB, grub2 is now used on IBM Power Systems installation media
instead of yaboot. (BZ#1131199) 
 Support for the little-endian variant of IBM Power Systems has been added, so
the lorax utility can now create installation media for this platform.
(BZ#1136490)
        Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
