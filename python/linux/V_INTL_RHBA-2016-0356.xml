  <Title>rhel-guest-image bug fix update</Title>
  <Description>
        
The rhel-guest-image package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM Guest Image for cloud instances. This image is provided as a minimally configured system image which is available for use as-is or for configuration and customization as required by end users.
OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.
A padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0
(SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to decrypt
RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol
version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol
attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)
Note: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by default
when using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing support for weak
SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to the knowledge base
article linked to in the References section.
A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2
ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result in weak
SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)
A side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts on
the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the ability
to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the
victim's thread that is performing decryption, could use this flaw to
recover RSA private keys. (CVE-2016-0702)
A double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain malformed
DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An attacker could create
specially crafted DSA private keys that, when processed by an application
compiled against OpenSSL, could cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2016-0705)
An integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a
heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM functions of
OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these functions with large
untrusted input could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-0797)
Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.

Users of rhel-guest-image are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which includes the updated openssl packages.
        Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
