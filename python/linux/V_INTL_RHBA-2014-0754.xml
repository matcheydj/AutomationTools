  <Title>rhel-guest-image bug fix and enhancement update</Title>
  <Description>
        
The rhel-quest-image packages provide a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 KVM Guest
Image for cloud instances. This image is provided as a minimally configured
system image which is available for use as-is or for configuration and
customization as required by end users.
This update fixes the following bugs:
 OpenStack creates virtual machines with a serial port, reads the output from
the port and keeps a buffer of several last lines written on the serial console.
However, because the output of scripts in the cloud-init packages as well as
many other logs was displayed on the system console (/dev/console), this content
could be lost. With this update, the /dev/ttyS0 file has been set as an alias
for /dev/console, which is the first serial port. As a result, could-init sends
the output to the serial console instead the system console, and these messages
can therefore be read by OpenStack as expected. (BZ#1065007)
 Previously, the yum-config-manager utility was not included in the yum-utils
tools provided by the rhel-guest-image packages. As a consequence, no
repositories could be enabled because the "yum-config-manager --enable" command
could not be found, and an error message was displayed. With this update,
yum-config-manager has been added, and enabling repositories now works as
expected. (BZ#1072756)
In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:
 This update adds the heat-cfntools package, which is needed to ship the
guest-image packages with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform.
(BZ#1062343)
 This update adds the rhevm-guest-agent package to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
guest images. Now, Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines can be installed
with a guest agent in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. The rhevm-guest-agent
allows the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to receive internal guest
events and retrieve information such as the IP address and list of installed
applications from the guest. This update contains kernel version
2.6.32-431.11.2, and a new rhevm-guest-agent-common package. (BZ#1074841)
 With this update, the root file system of Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest
images (in the qcow2 file format) is resized to the space that is available.
Previously, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest images contained only a 6-GB root
file, which could be insufficient under certain circumstances. Now, the scripts
provided by the cloud-init packages can expand the partition and the file system
automatically. (BZ#1064970)
 Prior to this update, the nfs-utils packages were not included in the
rhel-guest-image packages. Consequently, Network File System (NFS) shares could
not be mounted, and an error message was displayed. With this update, the
missing packages have been added, and the NFS server can be mounted as expected.
(BZ#1072757)
Users of rhel-guest-image are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which fix these bugs and add these enhancements.
        Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
