  <Title>python-blivet bug fix and enhancement update</Title>
  <Description>
        
The python-blivet package is a Python module for examining and modifying storage configuration.
This update fixes the following bugs:
 Because the blivet utility used regular expressions to select devices, selecting devices with names that ended in the "p" separator caused the installation to fail. This update adjusts to use the device path to select devices, which prevents the described crash. (BZ#1181336)
 When resizing partitions created by the autopart utility in a custom spoke, a miscalculation could occur that caused the Volume Group (VG) to have a negative amount of free space. This in turn led to Anaconda terminating unexpectedly. With this update, when calculating space, the free partition regions are aligned in such a way to prevent calculation problems, thus avoiding the crash. (BZ#1083687)
 If the system was installed from a removable medium and an install or storage option was selected but then changed, the installation failed. Consequently, it was not possible to reconsider decisions made during the installation process. This update prevents the installation failure. (BZ#1075671)
 Installations to a Logical Volume (LV) on a RAID array that used the kickstart utility with the "--grow" option did not take into account the amount of extra space reserved for metadata. In some cases, this resulted in the installation failing due to insufficient space. The space needed for metadata is now properly reflected, and the described installations work as expected. (BZ#1093144)
 Because the IBM System z architecture cannot have an encrypted /boot partition, installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on IBM System z failed if encryption and auto-partitioning were used. Now, the default /boot partition on IBM System z is set as a normal partition, which prevents the described installation failure. (BZ#1147501)
 Using the "zerombr" command in combination with the "clearpart" command during a kickstart installation led to blank disks not initializing properly, and thus caused the installation to fail. Now, "zerombr" properly initializes blank disks even when "clearpart" is used, and thus no longer causes the failure. (BZ#1117946)
 Previously, blivet did not properly mount iSCSI devices with the _netdev option. As a consequence, the devices were in some cases not cleanly unmounted when shutting down the installation. This could cause problems with rebooting due to unclean file systems. The bug has been fixed and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1166509)
In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:
 Previously, the python_blivet package could not be installed on Apple Mac hardware. With this update, python_blivet can be installed on a standard VFAT Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) System partition and no longer requires a HFS+ file system, which allows the installation of python_blivet on Apple Mac hardware. (BZ#1130588)
 With this update, blivet allows mounting degraded RAID arrays in rescue mode. This allows for better examination and debugging of the degraded RAID. (BZ#1090009)
 IBM PowerPC's Open Firmware now supports GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning, which allows users to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux to a GPT-labeled disk on the PowerPC architecture. (BZ#1102917)
 Anaconda now limits the suggested swap space to 10% of free disk space, instead of 10% of all disk space. This makes automatic partitioning significantly more reliable, especially on very large disks. (BZ#1053462)
 The maximum size of BTRFS volumes has been increased from 16 TiB to 16 EiB. (BZ#1114435)
 With this update, blivet no longer limits the size of thinly-provisioned LVs to the amount of free space on the VG. This allows for creation of larger thinly-provisioned LVs. (BZ#1100772)
Users of python-blivet are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these bugs and adds these enhancements.
        Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
