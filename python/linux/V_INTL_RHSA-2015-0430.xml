  <Title>Moderate: virt-who security, bug fix, and enhancement update</Title>
  <Description>An updated virt-who package that fixes one security issue, several bugs, and adds various enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section. The virt-who package provides an agent that collects information about virtual guests present in the system and reports them to the subscription manager. It was discovered that the /etc/sysconfig/virt-who configuration file, which may contain hypervisor authentication credentials, was world-readable. A local user could use this flaw to obtain authentication credentials from this file. (CVE-2014-0189) Red Hat would like to thank Sal Castiglione for reporting this issue. The virt-who package has been upgraded to upstream version 0.11, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. The most notable bug fixes and enhancements include: * Support for remote libvirt. * A fix for using encrypted passwords. * Bug fixes and enhancements that increase the stability of virt-who. (BZ#1122489) This update also fixes the following bugs: * Prior to this update, the virt-who agent failed to read the list of virtual guests provided by the VDSM daemon. As a consequence, when in VDSM mode, the virt-who agent was not able to send updates about virtual guests to Subscription Asset Manager (SAM) and Red Hat Satellite. With this update, the agent reads the list of guests when in VDSM mode correctly and reports to SAM and Satellite as expected. (BZ#1153405) * Previously, virt-who used incorrect information when connecting to Red Hat Satellite 5. Consequently, virt-who could not connect to Red Hat Satellite 5 servers. The incorrect parameter has been corrected, and virt-who can now successfully connect to Red Hat Satellite 5. (BZ#1158859) * Prior to this update, virt-who did not decode the hexadecimal representation of a password before decrypting it. As a consequence, the decrypted password did not match the original password, and attempts to connect using the password failed. virt-who has been updated to decode the encrypted password and, as a result, virt-who now handles storing credentials using encrypted passwords as expected. (BZ#1161607) In addition, this update adds the following enhancement: * With this update, virt-who is able to read the list of guests from a remote libvirt hypervisor. (BZ#1127965) Users of virt-who are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these enhancements. Note for remediation: Please disable the SELinux for RHEL 4/5 when repairing, or some rpm packages will fail to install.</Description>
