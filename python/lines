The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force 
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the 
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days. 
 
Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent 
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the 
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS 
parameter be set to 7 or more days. 
 
Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users 
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the 
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days. 
Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of 
a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down 
where it may be discovered.

The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating 
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the 
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by 
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command 
into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.) in their home directories.

Monitor for unsuccessful attempts to access files. The parameters below are associated 
with system calls that control creation (creat), opening (open, openat) and truncation 
(truncate, ftruncate) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a non-
privileged user (auid > = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the 
system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other 
permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged 
with the identifier "access."

Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file 
attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file), 
unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file 
attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete". 
Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator 
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with 
protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system 
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or 
altered. 
Audit: 
For 64 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if file deletion events by user are recorded. 
# grep delete /etc/audit/audit.rules

5.2.15 Collect Changes to System Administration Scope (sudoers) 
(Scored) 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly 
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the 
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope. 
The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The 
audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope." 
 
Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
Monitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of 
the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to 
execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to 
/var/log/sudo.log. Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as 
command will be written to the log. 
 
Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a 
kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated 
program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and 
unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a 
module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the 
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with 
an identifier of "modules".

verify) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The -V 
option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages (-Va). If 
no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the 
meaning of output from the verify option: 
Code Meaning  
S File size differs.  
M File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).  
5 The MD5 checksum differs.  
D The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.  
L A mismatch occurs in a link.  
U The file ownership differs.  
G The file group owner differs.  
T The file time (mtime) differs.  
The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs 
to. For example the following command determines which package the /etc/passwd file 
belongs to: 
# rpm -qf /etc/passwd 
setup-2.5.58-7.el5  
To verify the settings for the package that controls the /etc/passwd file, run the following: 
# rpm -V setup-2.5.58-7.el5 
.M...... c /etc/passwd 
S.5....T c /etc/printcap  
Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: 
# rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` 
.M...... c /etc/passwd 
S.5....T c /etc/printcap

In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets 
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined 
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from 
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets 
would need to be used. 
 
Note: This content will only provide detection of the security threat or vulnerability.  Remediation must be performed manually.
ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host 
(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside 
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect 
messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables.

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 
forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if 
the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not 
go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is 
dropped (and logged if log_martians is set).

When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the 
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN 
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the 
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that 
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet 
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake 
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has 
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no 
corresponding SYN in the queue.

The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged. 
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically

so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. INFO level is the 
basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident 
Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The 
logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.
