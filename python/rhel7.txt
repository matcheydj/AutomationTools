Overview 
This document, CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Benchmark, provides prescriptive guidance 
for establishing a secure configuration posture for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 
version 7.0 running on x86 and x64 platforms. To obtain the latest version of this guide, 
please visit http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org. If you have questions, comments, or have 
identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org. 
Intended Audience 
This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, 
auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy, 
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. 
Consensus Guidance 
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised subject matter 
experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of backgrounds 
including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security research, 
operations, government, and legal.  
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs 
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene 
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until 
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins 
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the 
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the 
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit 
https://community.cisecurity.org.

Recommendations 
1 Install Updates, Patches and Additional Security Software 
1.1 Filesystem Configuration 
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing 
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables 
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. User's data 
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a 
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for 
system operations. The directives in this section are easier to perform during initial system 
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be 
performed before repartitioning the system. 
Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data 
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the 
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old 
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system 
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data 
to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is 
mounted unless it is removed first. 
1.1.1 Create Separate Partition for /tmp (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users 
and some applications. 
Rationale: 
Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource 
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file 
system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp 
useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from 
establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the 
program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own 
copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker 
could continue to exploit the known flaw. 
Audit: 
Verify that there is a /tmp file partition in the /etc/fstab file. 
# grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
Remediation: 
For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create a 
separate partition for /tmp. 
For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to 
create partitions.

1.1.2 Set nodev option for /tmp Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices. 
Rationale: 
Since the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that 
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /tmp. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is configured as recommended. 
# grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab | grep nodev 
# mount | grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" | grep nodev  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options). See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
# mount -o remount,nodev /tmp  
1.1.3 Set nosuid option for /tmp Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain set userid files. 
Rationale: 
Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to 
ensure that users cannot create set userid files in /tmp. 
# mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp  
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is configured as recommended. 
# grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab | grep nosuid 
# mount | grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" | grep nosuid  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options). See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
1.1.4 Set noexec option for /tmp Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries. 
Rationale: 
Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to 
ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /tmp. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is configured as recommended. 
# grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab | grep noexec 
# mount | grep "[[:space:]]/tmp[[:space:]]" | grep noexec  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options). See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
# mount -o remount,noexec /tmp  
1.1.5 Create Separate Partition for /var (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store 
dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable. 
Rationale: 
Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of 
resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. 
Audit: 
# grep "[[:space:]]/var[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
<volume> /var <fstype> <options> 
Remediation: 
For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create a 
separate partition for /var. 
For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to 
create partitions. 
References: 
1.  AJ Lewis, "LVM HOWTO", http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ 
1.1.6 Bind Mount the /var/tmp directory to /tmp (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /var/tmp directory is normally a standalone directory in the /var file system. Binding 
/var/tmp to /tmp establishes an unbreakable link to /tmp that cannot be removed (even by 
the root user). It also allows /var/tmp to inherit the same mount options that /tmp owns, 
allowing /var/tmp to be protected in the same /tmp is protected. It will also prevent /var 
from filling up with temporary files as the contents of /var/tmp will actually reside in the 
file system containing /tmp. 
Rationale: 
All programs that use /var/tmp and /tmp to read/write temporary files will always be 
written to the /tmp file system, preventing a user from running the /var file system out of 
space or trying to perform operations that have been blocked in the /tmp filesystem. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the system is configured as recommended: 
# grep -e "^/tmp[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab | grep /var/tmp 
/tmp /var/tmp none none 0 0 
# mount | grep -e "^/tmp[[:space:]]" | grep /var/tmp 
/tmp on /var/tmp type none (rw,bind)  
If the above commands emit no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# mount --bind /tmp /var/tmp  
and edit the /etc/fstab file to contain the following line: 
/tmp /var/tmp none bind 0 0  
1.1.7 Create Separate Partition for /var/log (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data . 
Rationale: 
There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate 
partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and 
protection of audit data. 
Audit: 
# grep "[[:space:]]/var/log[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
<volume> /var/log <fstype> <options> 
Remediation: 
For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create a 
separate partition for /var/log. 
For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to 
create partitions. 
References: 
1.  AJ Lewis, "LVM HOWTO", http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ 
1.1.8 Create Separate Partition for /var/log/audit (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory. 
Rationale: 
There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a 
separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can 
grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free 
space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog) 
consume space in the same partition as auditd, it may not perform as desired. 
Audit: 
# grep "[[:space:]]/var/log/audit[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
<volume> /var/log/audit <fstype> <options>  
Remediation: 
For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create a 
separate partition for /var/log/audit. For systems that were previously installed, use the 
Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions. 
References: 
1.  AJ Lewis, "LVM HOWTO", http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ 
1.1.9 Create Separate Partition for /home (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users. 
Rationale: 
If the system is intended to support local users, create a separate partition for the /home 
directory to protect against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be 
stored under /home. 
Audit: 
# grep "[[:space:]]/home[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
<volume> /home <fstype> <options>  
Remediation: 
For new installations, check the box to "Review and modify partitioning" and create a 
separate partition for /home. 
For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to 
create partitions. 
References: 
1.  AJ Lewis, "LVM HOWTO", http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ 
1.1.10 Add nodev Option to /home (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
When set on a file system, this option prevents character and block special devices from 
being defined, or if they exist, from being used as character and block special devices. 
Rationale: 
Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that 
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices. 
Note: The actions in the item refer to the /home partition, which is the default user 
partition that is defined in RHEL7. If you have created other user partitions, it is 
recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as well. 
Audit: 
# grep "[[:space:]]/home[[:space:]]" /etc/fstab 
Verify that nodev is an option 
# mount | grep /home 
<each user partition> on <mount point> type <fstype> (nodev)  
Note: There may be other options listed for this filesystem 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options). See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
# mount -o remount,nodev /home  
1.1.11 Add nodev Option to Removable Media Partitions (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set nodev on removable media to prevent character and block special devices that are 
present on the removable be treated as these device files. 
Rationale: 
Removable media containing character and block special devices could be used to 
circumvent security controls by allowing non-root users to access sensitive device files 
such as /dev/kmem or the raw disk partitions. 
Audit: 
# grep <each removable media mountpoint> /etc/fstab 
Verify that nodev is an option  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add "nodev" to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for 
entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
1.1.12 Add noexec Option to Removable Media Partitions (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set noexec on removable media to prevent programs from executing from the removable 
media. 
Rationale: 
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from the 
removable. This deters users from being to introduce potentially malicious software on the 
system. 
Audit: 
# grep <each removable media mountpoint> /etc/fstab  
Note: Verify that noexec is an option 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for 
entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
1.1.13 Add nosuid Option to Removable Media Partitions (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set nosuid on removable media to prevent setuid and setgid executable files that are on 
that media from being executed as setuid and setgid. 
Rationale: 
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs 
onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them. 
Audit: 
# grep <each removable media mountpoint> /etc/fstab 
Verify that nosuid is an option  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for 
entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the 
fstab(5) manual page for more information. 
1.1.14 Add nodev Option to /dev/shm Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The nodev mount option specifies that the /dev/shm (temporary filesystem stored in 
memory) cannot contain block or character special devices. 
Rationale: 
Since the /dev/shm filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure 
that users cannot attempt to create special devices in /dev/shm partitions. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is in configured as recommended: 
# grep /dev/shm /etc/fstab | grep nodev 
# mount | grep /dev/shm | grep nodev  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options of entries 
that have mount points that contain /dev/shm. See the fstab(5) manual page for more 
information. 
# mount -o remount,nodev /dev/shm  
1.1.15 Add nosuid Option to /dev/shm Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The nosuid mount option specifies that the /dev/shm (temporary filesystem stored in 
memory) will not execute setuid and setgid on executable programs as such, but rather 
execute them with the uid and gid of the user executing the program. 
Rationale: 
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs 
onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is in configured as recommended: 
# grep /dev/shm /etc/fstab | grep nosuid 
# mount | grep /dev/shm | grep nosuid  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for 
entries that have mount points that contain /dev/shm. See the fstab(5) manual page for 
more information. 
# mount -o remount,nosuid /dev/shm  
1.1.16 Add noexec Option to /dev/shm Partition (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set noexec on the shared memory partition to prevent programs from executing from 
there. 
Rationale: 
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from shared 
memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious software on the system. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands to determine if the system is in configured as recommended: 
# grep /dev/shm /etc/fstab | grep noexec 
# mount | grep /dev/shm | grep noexec  
If either command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for 
entries that have mount points that contain /dev/shm. See the fstab(5) manual page for

1.1.17 Set Sticky Bit on All World-Writable Directories (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or 
renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them. 
Rationale: 
This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories 
(such as /tmp) that are owned by another user. 
Audit: 
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d 
\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null 
Remediation: 
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d 
\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null | xargs chmod a+t 
1.1.18 Disable Mounting of cramfs Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The cramfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small 
footprint systems. A cramfs image can be used without having to first decompress the 
image. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v cramfs 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep cramfs 
<No output> 
Remediation:

1.1.19 Disable Mounting of freevxfs Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The freevxfs filesystem type is a free version of the Veritas type filesystem. This is the 
primary filesystem type for HP-UX operating systems. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v freevxfs 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep freevxfs 
<No output> 
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install freevxfs /bin/true  
1.1.20 Disable Mounting of jffs2 Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The jffs2 (journaling flash filesystem 2) filesystem type is a log-structured filesystem 
used in flash memory devices. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v jffs2 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep jffs2 
<No output>  
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install jffs2 /bin/true  
1.1.21 Disable Mounting of hfs Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The hfs filesystem type is a hierarchical filesystem that allows you to mount Mac OS 
filesystems. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v hfs 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep hfs 
<No output>  
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install hfs /bin/true  
1.1.22 Disable Mounting of hfsplus Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The hfsplus filesystem type is a hierarchical filesystem designed to replace hfs that 
allows you to mount Mac OS filesystems. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v hfsplus 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep hfsplus 
<No output>  
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install hfsplus /bin/true  
1.1.23 Disable Mounting of squashfs Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in 
small footprint systems (similar to cramfs). A squashfs image can be used without having 
to first decompress the image. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v squashfs 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep squashfs 
<No output> 
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install squashfs /bin/true  
1.1.24 Disable Mounting of udf Filesystems (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The udf filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and 
ECMA-167 specifications. This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a 
broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer 
optical disc formats. 
Rationale: 
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. 
Audit: 
# /sbin/modprobe -n -v udf 
install /bin/true 
# /sbin/lsmod | grep udf 
<No output> 
Remediation: 
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: 
install udf /bin/true 
1.2 Configure Software Updates 
Red Hat uses the yum command line tool to install and update software packages. Updating 
the RHEL7 software via the Internet requires a valid Red Hat subscription. Patch 
management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may 
choose to install a Red Hat Satellite Update server that can be used in place of Red Hat's 
servers, whereas a single deployment of a Red Hat system may prefer to get updates from 
Red Hat's servers. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the 
site's policy for patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-
production system before rolling out to production. 
For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management 
system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to 
the organization. 
1.2.1 Configure Connection to the RHN RPM Repositories (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Systems need to be registered with the Red Hat Network (RHN) to receive patch updates. 
This is usually configured during initial installation. 
Rationale: 
It is important to register with the Red Hat Network to make sure that patches are updated 
on a regular basis. This helps to reduce the exposure time as new vulnerabilities are 
discovered. 
Audit: 
Verify that the system is registered by executing the following command: 
# yum check-update  
Remediation: 
If your system is not listed on the RHN site as a registered system, run the Red Hat Network 
Registration tool as follows: 
# rhn_register  
Follow the prompts on the screen. If successful, the system will appear on the RHN web site 
and be subscribed to one or more software update channels. Additionally, a new daemon, 
rhnsd, will be enabled. 
1.2.2 Verify Red Hat GPG Key is Installed (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Red Hat cryptographically signs updates with a GPG key to verify that they are valid. 
Rationale: 
It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect against 
spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the system. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to ensure that the system has the Red Hat GPG key properly 
installed: 
# rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey  
Remediation: 
Compare the GPG fingerprint with the one from Red Hat's web site at 
http://www.redhat.com/security/team/key. The following command can be used to print 
the installed release key's fingerprint, which is actually contained in the file referenced 
below: 
# gpg --quiet --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release  
More information on package signing is also available at 
https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key. 
References: 
1.  More information on package signing is also available at 
https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key 
1.2.3 Verify that gpgcheck is Globally Activated (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The gpgcheck option, found in the main section of the /etc/yum.conf file determines if an 
RPM package's signature is always checked prior to its installation. 
Rationale: 
It is important to ensure that an RPM's package signature is always checked prior to 
installation to ensure that the software is obtained from a trusted source. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to verify that gpgcheck is set to 1 in all occurrences of the 
/etc/yum.conf file: 
# grep gpgcheck /etc/yum.conf 
gpgcheck=1  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/yum.conf file and set the gpgcheck to 1 as follows: 
gpgcheck=1  
1.2.4 Disable the rhnsd Daemon (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The rhnsd daemon polls the Red Hat Network web site for scheduled actions and, if there 
are, executes those actions. 
Rationale: 
Patch management policies may require that organizations test the impact of a patch 
before it is deployed in a production environment. Having patches automatically deployed 
could have a negative impact on the environment. It is best to not allow an action by default 
but only after appropriate consideration has been made. It is recommended that the service 
be disabled unless the risk is understood and accepted or you are running your own 
satellite . This item is not scored because organizations may have addressed the risk. 
Audit: 
# systemctl is-enabled rhnsd 
Ensure result is not enabled. 
Remediation: 
Disable the rhnsd daemon by running the following command: 
# systemctl disable rhnsd 
1.2.5 Obtain Software Package Updates with yum (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The yum update utility performs software updates, including dependency analysis, based 
on repository metadata and can be run manually from the command line, invoked from one 
of the provided front-end tools, or configured to run automatically at specified intervals. 
Rationale: 
The yum update utility is the preferred method to update software since it checks for 
dependencies and ensures that the software is installed correctly. Refer to your local patch 
management procedures for the method used to perform yum updates. 
Audit: 
Perform the following command to determine if there are any packages that need to be 
updated: 
# yum check-update 
Remediation: 
# yum update 
1.2.6 Verify Package Integrity Using RPM (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
RPM has the capability of verifying installed packages by comparing the installed files 
against the file information stored in the package. 
Rationale: 
Verifying packages gives a system administrator the ability to detect if package files were 
changed, which could indicate that a valid binary was overwritten with a trojaned binary. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to verify integrity of installed packages. 
# rpm -qVa | awk '$2 != "c" { print $0}' 
If any output shows up, you may have an integrity issue with that package 
Note: Actions in other areas of the benchmark change permissions on some files to make 
them more secure than the default, which would cause this check to fail. It is important to 
validate the packages either have the permissions they were intended to have, or have been 
intentionally altered. It is recommended that any output generated in the audit step be 
investigated to justify the discrepancy. 
Remediation: 
Address unexpected discrepancies identified in the audit step. 
1.3 Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) 
AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent 
intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the 
files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be 
concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation 
before proceeding. 
1.3.1 Install AIDE (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
In some installations, AIDE is not installed automatically. 
Rationale: 
Install AIDE to make use of the file integrity features to monitor critical files for changes 
that could affect the security of the system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if AIDE is installed. 
# rpm -q aide 
aide.<package version>.<hardware platform> 
Remediation: 
Use yum to install AIDE (-y option may be used to assume yes at all prompts): 
# yum install aide 
<Output messages from Yum install> 
aide.<hardware platform> <package version> installed 
Initialize AIDE: 
# /usr/sbin/aide --init -B 'database_out=file:/var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz' 
Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up 
their start up times. Set PRELINKING=no in /etc/sysconfig/prelink and run 
/usr/sbin/prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus avoiding false 
positives from AIDE. 
1.3.2 Implement Periodic Execution of File Integrity (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Implement periodic file checking, in compliance with site policy. 
Rationale: 
Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if 
critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if there is a cron job scheduled to run the aide check. 
# crontab -u root -l | grep aide 
0 5 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check  
Remediation: 
Execute the following command: 
# crontab -u root -e  
Add the following line to the crontab: 
0 5 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check  
Note: The checking in this instance occurs every day at 5am. Alter the frequency and time 
of the checks in compliance with site policy. 
1.4 Configure SELinux 
SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the 
default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every 
object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that 
includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access 
objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines 
transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a 
different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the 
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any 
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions 
must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either 
one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a 
system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to 
allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have 
been designed for use with RHEL7 and are included with the system: targeted, strict, and 
mls. These are described as follows: 
  targeted: consists mostly of Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of 
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many 
types of programs, but leaves interactive users largely unaffected. 
  strict: also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively. 
  mls: implements MulLevel Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of 
labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. 
This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy.

1.4.1 Ensure SELinux is not disabled in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Configure SELINUX to be enabled at boot time and verify that it has not been overwritten 
by the grub boot parameters 
Rationale: 
SELinux must be enabled at boot time in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to ensure that the 
controls it provides are not overwritten. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to verify that SELinux is enabled at boot time: 
# grep selinux=0 /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
[no output produced] 
# grep enforcing=0 /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
[no output produced] 
Remediation: 
Remove all instances of selinux=0 and enforcing=0 from /boot/grub2/grub.cfg. 
1.4.2 Set the SELinux State (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Set SELinux to enable when the system is booted. 
Rationale: 
SELinux must be enabled at boot time in to ensure that the controls it provides are in effect 
at all times. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if SELinux is enabled at boot time. 
# grep SELINUX=enforcing /etc/selinux/config 
SELINUX=enforcing 
# /usr/sbin/sestatus 
SELinux status: enabled 
Current mode: enforcing 
Mode from config file: enforcing 
Policy from config file: targeted  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the SELINUX parameter: 
SELINUX=enforcing 
1.4.3 Set the SELinux Policy (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Configure SELinux to meet or exceed the default targeted policy, which constrains daemons 
and system software only. 
Rationale: 
Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a 
policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is 
intended to ensure that at least the default recommendations are met. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the targeted policy is selected in the 
/etc/selinux/config file. 
# grep SELINUXTYPE=targeted /etc/selinux/config 
SELINUXTYPE=targeted 
# /usr/sbin/sestatus 
SELinux status: enabled 
Current mode: enforcing 
Mode from config file: enforcing 
Policy from config file: targeted  
Note: If your organization requires stricter policies, verify that they are selected by using 
the "grep" command on the /etc/selinux/config file. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the SELINUXTYPE parameter: 
SELINUXTYPE=targeted  
Note: If your organization requires stricter policies, make sure they are added to the 
/etc/selinux/config file. 
1.4.4 Remove SETroubleshoot (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The SETroubleshoot service notifies desktop users of SELinux denials through a user-
friendly interface. The service provides important information around configuration errors, 
unauthorized intrusions, and other potential errors. 
Rationale: 
The SETroubleshoot service is an unnecessary daemon to have running on a server, 
especially if X Windows is disabled. 
Audit: 
# rpm -q setroubleshoot 
setroubleshoot.<package version>.<hardware platform> 
Remediation: 
# yum erase setroubleshoot 
1.4.5 Remove MCS Translation Service (mcstrans) (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The mcstransd daemon provides category label information to client processes requesting 
information. The label translations are defined in /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf 
Rationale: 
Since this service is not used very often, disable it to reduce the amount of potentially 
vulnerable code running on the system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if mctrans is disabled: 
# rpm -q mcstrans 
mcstrans.<package version>.<hardware platform> 
Remediation: 
# yum erase mcstrans 
1.4.6 Check for Unconfined Daemons (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their 
parent process. 
Rationale: 
Since daemons are launched and descend from the init process, they will inherit the 
security context label initrc_t. This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the 
process more permission than it requires. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if unconfined daemons are running on the system. 
# ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk" | tr ':' ' ' | awk '{ 
print $NF }' 
[no output produced] 
Remediation: 
Investigate any unconfined daemons found during the audit action. 
1.5 Secure Boot Settings 
1.5.1 Set User/Group Owner on /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set the owner and group of /boot/grub2/grub.cfgto the root user. 
Rationale: 
Setting the owner and group to root prevents non-root users from changing the file. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file has the correct 
ownership: 
# stat -L -c "%u %g" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | egrep "0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
1.5.2 Set Permissions on /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set permission on the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file to read and write for root only. 
Rationale: 
Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from 
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot 
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit 
them. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file permissions are 
correct: 
# stat -L -c "%a" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | egrep ".00"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
1.5.3 Set Boot Loader Password (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter 
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters 
Rationale: 
Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized 
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users 
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time). 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if a password is required to set command line boot 
parameters: 
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
set superusers="<user-list>" 
# grep "^password" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
password_pbkdf2 <user> <encrypted password> 
At least one user must be specified as a super user and have a password assigned. 
Remediation: 
Create an encrypted password with grub-md5-crypt: 
# grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 
Enter password: <password> 
Reenter password: <password> 
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>  
Add the following into /etc/grub.d/00_header or a custom /etc/grub.d configuration 
file: 
cat <<EOF 
set superusers="<user-list>" 
password_pbkdf2 <user> <encrypted-password> 
EOF 
Run the following to update the grub configuration: 
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
1.6 Additional Process Hardening 
1.6.1 Restrict Core Dumps (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine 
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core 
file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be 
overridden by the user. 
Rationale: 
Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core 
dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5)). In 
addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from 
dumping core. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if core dumps are restricted. 
# grep "hard core" /etc/security/limits.conf 
* hard core 0 
# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable 
fs.suid_dumpable = 0 
Remediation: 
Add the following line to the /etc/security/limits.conf file. 
* hard core 0  
Add the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file. 
fs.suid_dumpable = 0  
1.6.2 Enable Randomized Virtual Memory Region Placement (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set the system flag to force randomized virtual memory region placement. 
Rationale: 
Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult for to write memory page 
exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if virtual memory is randomized. 
# sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space 
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2 
Remediation: 
Add the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file. 
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2 
1.7 Use the Latest OS Release (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Periodically, Red Hat releases updates to the Red Hat operating system to support new 
hardware platforms, deliver new functionality as well as the bundle together a set of 
patches that can be tested as a unit. 
Rationale: 
Newer updates may contain security enhancements that would not be available through 
the standard patching process. As a result, it is recommended that the latest update of the 
Red Hat software be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software 
installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements 
and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the 
update revision that is selected. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the current OS level: 
# uname -r  
or 
# cat /etc/redhat-release 
Remediation: 
Use the latest update when installing new systems and upgrade to or reinstall with the 
latest update as appropriate for existing systems. 
2 OS Services 
While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the 
best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all 
services that are not required for normal system operation.  This prevents the exploitation 
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be 
exploited.  The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on what services 
can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of 
possible threats to the resulting system. 
2.1 Remove Legacy Services 
The items in this section are intended to ensure that legacy services are not installed on the 
system. Some guidance includes directives to both disable and remove the service. There is 
no good reason to have these services on the system, even in a disabled state.  
Note: The audit items in the section check to see if the packages are listed in the yum 
database and installed using rpm. It could be argued that someone may have installed them 
separately. However, this is also true for any other type of rogue software. It is beyond the 
scope of this benchmark to address software that is installed using non-standard methods 
and installation directories.  
2.1.1 Remove telnet-server (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The telnet-server package contains the telnetd daemon, which accepts connections from 
users from other systems via the telnet protocol. 
Rationale: 
The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission 
medium could allow a user with access to sniff network traffic the ability to steal 
credentials. The ssh package provides an encrypted session and stronger security and is 
included in most Red Hat Linux distributions. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the telnet-server package is on the system. 
# rpm -q telnet-server 
package telnet-server is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase telnet-server 
2.1.2 Remove telnet Clients (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The telnet package contains the telnet client, which allows users to start connections to 
other systems via the telnet protocol. 
Rationale: 
The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission 
medium could allow an authorized user to steal credentials. The ssh package provides an 
encrypted session and stronger security and is included in most Red Hat Linux 
distributions. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the telnet package is on the system. 
# rpm -q telnet 
package telnet is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase telnet

credentials in clear-text. 
Rationale: 
These legacy service contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with 
the more secure SSH package. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if rsh-server is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q rsh-server 
package rsh-server is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase rsh-server 
2.1.4 Remove rsh (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services. 
Rationale: 
These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the 
more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are 
also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and 
therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes the 
clients for rsh, rcp and rlogin. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if rsh is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q rsh 
package rsh is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase rsh 
2.1.5 Remove NIS Client (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server 
directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client 
(ypbind) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed 
configuration files. 
Rationale: 
The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks, 
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has 
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is 
recommended that the service be removed. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if ypbind is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q ypbind 
package ypbind is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase ypbind

3 Special Purpose Services 
This section describes services that are installed on servers that specifically need to run 
these services. If any of these services are not required, it is recommended that they be 
disabled or deleted from the system to reduce the potential attack surface. 
3.1 Set Daemon umask (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Set the default umask for all processes started at boot time. The settings in umask 
selectively turn off default permission when a file is created by a daemon process. 
Rationale: 
Setting the umask to 027 will make sure that files created by daemons will not be readable, 
writable or executable by any other than the group and owner of the daemon process and 
will not be writable by the group of the daemon process. The daemon process can manually 
override these settings if these files need additional permission. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the daemon umask is set. 
# grep umask /etc/sysconfig/init 
umask 027 
Remediation: 
Add the following line to the /etc/sysconfig/init file.

3.2 Remove the X Window System (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The X Window system provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have 
multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Window system is 
typically used on desktops where users login, but not on servers where users typically do 
not login. 
Rationale: 
Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via the X Window 
System, remove the server to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to ensure the system is not booting into graphical mode: 
ls -l /etc/systemd/system/default.target | grep graphical.target 
No results should be returned. 
Perform the following to determine if the X Window server is installed on the system: 
# rpm -q xorg-x11-server-common 
package xorg-x11-server-common is not installed 
Remediation: 
Change the default runlevel to multi user without X: 
# cd /etc/systemd/system/ 
# unlink default.target 
# ln -s /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target default.target 
Uninstall the X Window Server: 
# yum remove xorg-x11-server-common 
3.3 Disable Avahi Server (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD 
service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts 
running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a 
computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at 
and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine. 
Rationale: 
Since servers are not normally used for printing, this service is not needed unless 
dependencies require it. If this is the case, disable the service to reduce the potential attack 
surface. If for some reason the service is required on the server, follow the 
recommendations in sub-sections 3.2.1 - 3.2.5 to secure it. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if Avahi is disabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled avahi-daemon 
Ensure result is not enabled. 
Remediation: 
# systemctl disable avahi-daemon 
3.4 Disable Print Server - CUPS (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and 
network printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems 
and print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration 
capability. 
Rationale: 
If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is 
recommended that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if CUPS is disabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled cups 
disabled 
Remediation: 
systemctl disabled cups 
References: 
1.  More detailed documentation on CUPS is available at the project homepage at

3.5 Remove DHCP Server (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a service that allows machines to be 
dynamically assigned IP addresses. 
Rationale: 
Unless a server is specifically set up to act as a DHCP server, it is recommended that this 
service be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if DHCP is disabled. 
# rpm -q dhcp 
package dhcp is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase dhcp  
References: 
1.  More detailed documentation on DHCP is available at 
http://www.isc.org/software/dhcp. 
3.6 Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize system clocks across a 
variety of systems and use a source that is highly accurate. The version of NTP delivered 
with Red Hat can be found at http://www.ntp.org. NTP can be configured to be a client 
and/or a server. 
Rationale: 
It is recommended that physical systems and virtual guests lacking direct access to the 
physical host's clock be configured as NTP clients to synchronize their clocks (especially to 
support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos). This also ensures log files have 
consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations. 
Audit: 
The following script checks for the correct parameters on restrict default and restrict -6 
default: 
# grep "restrict default" /etc/ntp.conf 
restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery 
# grep "restrict -6 default" /etc/ntp.conf 
restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery  
Perform the following to determine if the system is configured to use an NTP Server and 
that the ntp daemon is running as an unprivileged user. 
# grep "^server" /etc/ntp.conf 
server  
# grep "ntp:ntp" /etc/sysconfig/ntpd 
OPTIONS="-u ntp:ntp -p /var/run/ntpd.pid"  
Remediation: 
Set the following restrict parameters in /etc/ntp.conf: 
restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery 
restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery 
Also, make sure /etc/ntp.conf has an NTP server specified: 
server <ntp-server> 
Note: <ntp-server> is the IP address or hostname of a trusted time server. Configuring an 
NTP server is outside the scope of this benchmark. 
Ensure -u ntp:ntp in options in /etc/sysconfig/ntpd: 
OPTIONS="-u ntp:ntp"  
References: 
1.  For more information on configuring NTP servers, go to the NTP homepage at 
http://www.ntp.org.  
3.7 Remove LDAP (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for 
NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central 
database. The default client/server LDAP application for Red Hat is OpenLDAP. 
Rationale: 
If the server will not need to act as an LDAP client or server, it is recommended that the 
software be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if LDAP is running. 
# rpm -q openldap-servers 
package openldap-servers is not installed 
# rpm -q openldap-clients 
package openldap-clients is not installed 
Remediation: 
If LDAP is running on the system and is not needed, remove it as follows: 
# yum erase openldap-servers 
# yum erase openldap-clients  
References:

3.8 Disable NFS and RPC (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Network File System (NFS) is one of the first and most widely distributed file systems 
in the UNIX environment. It provides the ability for systems to mount file systems of other 
servers through the network. 
Rationale: 
If the server does not export NFS shares or act as an NFS client, it is recommended that 
these services be disabled to reduce remote attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if NFS is disabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled nfslock 
# systemctl is-enabled rpcgssd 
# systemctl is-enabled rpcbind 
# systemctl is-enabled rpcidmapd 
# systemctl is-enabled rpcsvcgssd 
Ensure no commands return enabled. 
Remediation: 
# systemctl disable nfslock 
# systemctl disable rpcgssd 
# systemctl disable rpcbind 
# systemctl disable rpcidmapd 
# systemctl disable rpcsvcgssd 
3.9 Remove DNS Server (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system that maps names to IP 
addresses for computers, services and other resources connected to a network. 
Rationale: 
Unless a server is specifically designated to act as a DNS server, it is recommended that the 
package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if DNS is disabled on the system. 
# rpm -q bind 
package bind is not installed

# yum erase bind 
3.10 Remove FTP Server (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides networked computers with the ability to transfer 
files. 
Rationale: 
FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials. It is 
recommended sftp be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need to run the 
system as a FTP server (for example, to allow anonymous downloads), it is recommended 
that the package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if FTP is disabled. 
# rpm -q vsftpd 
package vsftpd is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase vsftpd 
3.11 Remove HTTP Server (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
HTTP or web servers provide the ability to host web site content. The default HTTP server 
shipped with Red Hat Linux is Apache. 
Rationale: 
Unless there is a need to run the system as a web server, it is recommended that the 
package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if apache is disabled. 
# rpm -q httpd 
package httpd is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase httpd 
3.12 Remove Dovecot (IMAP and POP3 services) (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 server for Linux based systems. 
Rationale: 
Unless POP3 and/or IMAP servers are to be provided to this server, it is recommended that 
the service be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if dovecot is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q dovecot 
package dovecot is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase dovecot 
References: 
1.  http://www.dovecot.org 
3.13 Remove Samba (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Samba daemon allows system administrators to configure their Linux systems to share 
file systems and directories with Windows desktops. Samba will advertise the file systems 
and directories via the Small Message Block (SMB) protocol. Windows desktop users will 
be able to mount these directories and file systems as letter drives on their systems. 
Rationale: 
If there is no need to mount directories and file systems to Windows systems, then this 
service can be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if samba is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q samba 
package samba is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase samba 
3.14 Remove HTTP Proxy Server (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The default HTTP proxy package shipped with Red Hat Linux is squid. 
Rationale: 
If there is no need for a proxy server, it is recommended that the squid proxy be deleted to 
reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if squid is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q squid 
package squid is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase squid 
3.15 Remove SNMP Server (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP 
commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the 
information and then send results back to the requesting system. 
Rationale: 
The SNMP server communicates using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does 
not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is 
recommended that the SNMP service not be used. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if net-snmp is installed on the system. 
# rpm -q net-snmp 
package net-snmp is not installed 
Remediation: 
# yum erase net-snmp 
3.16 Configure Mail Transfer Agent for Local-Only Mode (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming 
mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not 
intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process 
local mail. By default, the MTA is set to loopback mode on RHEL7. 
Rationale: 
The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of 
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail 
messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the 
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems. 
Note: RHEL5 uses sendmail as the default MTA while RHEL6 and RHEL7 uses Postfix. The 
recommendation to set the default MTA to local-only mode applies regardless of the MTA 
that is used.  
Audit: 
Perform the following command and make sure that the MTA is listening on the loopback 
address (127.0.0.1): 
# netstat -an | grep LIST | grep ":25[[:space:]]" 
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:25 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN  
Remediation: 
Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section. If 
the line already exists, change it to look like the line below. 
inet_interfaces = localhost 
# Execute the following command to restart postfix 
# service postfix restart 
4 Network Configuration and Firewalls 
This section provides guidance for secure network and firewall configuration. 
4.1 Modify Network Parameters (Host Only) 
The following network parameters determine if the system is to act as a host only. A system 
is considered host only if the system has a single interface, or has multiple interfaces but 
will not be configured as a router. 
4.1.1 Disable IP Forwarding (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The net.ipv4.ip_forward flag is used to tell the server whether it can forward packets or 
not. If the server is not to be used as a router, set the flag to 0. 
Rationale: 
Setting the flag to 0 ensures that a server with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard 
proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if net.ipv4.ip_forward is enabled on the system. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward 
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.ip_forward parameter to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.1.2 Disable Send Packet Redirects (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does 
not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects. 
Rationale: 
An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router 
devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the 
attacker as opposed to a valid system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if send packet redirects is disabled. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects and 
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects parameters to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2 Modify Network Parameters (Host and Router) 
The following network parameters determine if the system is to act as a router. A system 
acts as a router if it has at least two interfaces and is configured to perform routing 
functions. 
4.2.1 Disable Source Routed Packet Acceptance (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets 
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined 
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from 
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets 
would need to be used. 
Rationale: 
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route and 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting 
source routed packets. Assume this server was capable of routing packets to Internet 
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume 
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice 
versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable 
addresses could not use the server as a way to reach the private address servers. If, 
however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the 
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing 
protocols that did not allow this routing. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if accepting source routed packets is disabled. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route and 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route parameters to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.2 Disable ICMP Redirect Acceptance (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host 
(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside 
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect 
messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables. 
Rationale: 
Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing 
tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets 
to be captured. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if ICMP redirect messages will be rejected. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects parameters to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.3 Disable Secure ICMP Redirect Acceptance (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Secure ICMP redirects are the same as ICMP redirects, except they come from gateways 
listed on the default gateway list. It is assumed that these gateways are known to your 
system, and that they are likely to be secure. 
Rationale: 
It is still possible for even known gateways to be compromised. Setting 
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects to 0 protects the system from routing table 
updates by possibly compromised known gateways. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if ICMP redirect messages will be rejected from known 
gateways. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects 
net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects = 0 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects and 
net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects parameters to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects=0 
net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.4 Log Suspicious Packets (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
When enabled, this feature logs packets with un-routable source addresses to the kernel 
log. 
Rationale: 
Enabling this feature and logging these packets allows an administrator to investigate the 
possibility that an attacker is sending spoofed packets to their server. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if suspicious packets are logged. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians 
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians 
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians and net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians 
parameters to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1 
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.5 Enable Ignore Broadcast Requests (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all 
ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses. 
Rationale: 
Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for 
your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf 
attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast 
messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding 
would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not 
routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could 
be significantly multiplied. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast 
and multicast addresses will be ignored. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts 
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts parameter to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.6 Enable Bad Error Message Protection (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Setting icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses to 1 prevents the kernel from logging bogus 
responses (RFC-1122 non-compliant) from broadcast reframes, keeping file systems from 
filling up with useless log messages. 
Rationale: 
Some routers (and some attackers) will send responses that violate RFC-1122 and attempt 
to fill up a log file system with many useless error messages. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if bogus messages will be ignored. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses 
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses parameter to 1 in 
/etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.7 Enable RFC-recommended Source Route Validation (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 
forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if 
the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not 
go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is 
dropped (and logged if log_martians is set). 
Rationale: 
Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your server bogus packets 
that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if 
asymmetrical routing is employed. This is would occur when using dynamic routing 
protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your 
server, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if RFC-recommended source route validation is 
enabled. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter 
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter 
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter 
parameters to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1 
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.2.8 Enable TCP SYN Cookies (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the 
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN 
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the 
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that 
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet 
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake 
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has 
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no 
corresponding SYN in the queue. 
Rationale: 
Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a server by 
sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly 
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections 
from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the server to keep accepting valid connections, even if 
under a denial of service attack. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if TCP SYN Cookies is enabled. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies 
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies parameter to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 
4.3 Wireless Networking 
4.3.1 Deactivate Wireless Interfaces (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Wireless networking is used when wired networks are unavailable. Red Hat contains a 
wireless tool kit to allow system administrators to configure and use wireless networks. 
Rationale: 
If wireless is not to be used, wireless devices can be disabled to reduce the potential attack 
surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if wireless interfaces are active.  
# ip link show 
Validate that all interfaces using wireless are down.  
Remediation: 
Use the following commands to list all interfaces and identify devices with wireless 
interfaces. Once identified, shutdown the interface and remove it. 
# ip link show  
# iw list 
# ip link set <interface> down 
# rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface> 
4.4 IPv6 
IPv6 is a networking protocol that supersedes IPv4. It has more routable addresses and has 
built in security 
4.4.1 Configure IPv6 
If IPv6 is to be used, follow this section of the benchmark to configure IPv6. 
4.4.1.1 Disable IPv6 Router Advertisements (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
This setting disables the systems ability to accept router advertisements 
Rationale: 
It is recommended that systems not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked 
into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system 
(usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the system is disabled from accepting router 
advertisements: 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra 
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0  
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra parameter 
to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=0 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1 
4.4.1.2 Disable IPv6 Redirect Acceptance (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
This setting prevents the system from accepting ICMP redirects. ICMP redirects tell the 
system about alternate routes for sending traffic. 
Rationale: 
It is recommended that systems not accept ICMP redirects as they could be tricked into 
routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system (usually a 
single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if IPv6 redirects are disabled. 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects 
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirect = 0 
# /sbin/sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirect = 0 
Remediation: 
Set the net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects and 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects parameters to 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 
# /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1 
4.4.2 Disable IPv6 (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Although IPv6 has many advantages over IPv4, few organizations have implemented IPv6. 
Rationale: 
If IPv6 is not to be used, it is recommended that it be disabled to reduce the attack surface 
of the system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if IPv6 is enabled 
# grep net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 /etc/sysctl.conf 
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 
Remediation: 
Ensure net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 is set to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf: 
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 
Modify active kernel parameters to match: 
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 
4.5 Install TCP Wrappers 
4.5.1 Install TCP Wrappers (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services 
capable of supporting it. In the past, services that were called from inetd and xinetd 
supported the use of tcp wrappers. As inetd and xinetd have been falling in disuse, any 
service that can support tcp wrappers will have the libwrap.so library attached to it. 
Rationale: 
TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have 
that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers, 
use it. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if TCP Wrappers is enabled. 
# yum list tcp_wrappers 
tcp_wrappers.<hardware platform>    <release>    <installed> 
Remediation: 
# yum install tcp_wrappers  
To verify if a service supports TCP Wrappers, run the following command: 
# ldd <path-to-daemon> | grep libwrap.so  
If there is any output, then the service supports TCP Wrappers. 
4.5.2 Create /etc/hosts.allow (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/hosts.allow file specifies which IP addresses are permitted to connect to the 
host. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the /etc/hosts.deny file. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/hosts.allow file supports access control by IP and helps ensure that only 
authorized systems can connect to the server. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to verify the contents of the /etc/hosts.allow file.  
# cat /etc/hosts.allow 
[contents will vary, depending on your network configuration]  
Remediation: 
Create /etc/hosts.allow: 
# echo "ALL: <net>/<mask>, <net>/<mask>, …" >/etc/hosts.allow  
where each <net>/<mask> combination  (for example, "192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0") 
represents one network block in use by your organization that requires access to this 
system. 
4.5.3 Verify Permissions on /etc/hosts.allow (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/hosts.allow file contains networking information that is used by many 
applications and therefore must be readable for these applications to operate. 
Rationale: 
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.allow file is protected from unauthorized write 
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either 
inadvertently or through malicious actions. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/hosts.allow file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/hosts.allow 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/hosts.allow 
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/hosts.allow file are incorrect, run the following command 
to correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 644 /etc/hosts.allow  
4.5.4 Create /etc/hosts.deny (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/hosts.deny file specifies which IP addresses are not permitted to connect to the 
host. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the /etc/hosts.allow file. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/hosts.deny file serves as a failsafe so that any host not specified in 
/etc/hosts.allow is denied access to the server. 
Audit: 
Verify that /etc/hosts.deny exists and is configured to deny all hosts not explicitly listed 
in /etc/hosts.allow: 
# grep "ALL: ALL" /etc/hosts.deny 
ALL: ALL 
Remediation: 
Create /etc/hosts.deny: 
# echo "ALL: ALL" >> /etc/hosts.deny  
4.5.5 Verify Permissions on /etc/hosts.deny (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/hosts.deny file contains network information that is used by many system 
applications and therefore must be readable for these applications to operate. 
Rationale: 
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.deny file is protected from unauthorized write 
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either 
inadvertently or through malicious actions. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/hosts.deny file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/hosts.deny 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/hosts.deny 
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/hosts.deny file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 644 /etc/hosts.deny  
4.6 Uncommon Network Protocols 
Red Hat Linux supports several network protocols that are not commonly used. If these 
protocols are not needed, it is recommended that they be disabled in the kernel. 
4.6.1 Disable DCCP (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that 
supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to 
congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide in-
sequence delivery. 
Rationale: 
If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed  
to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if DCCP is disabled. 
# grep "install dccp /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
install dccp /bin/true 
Remediation: 
# echo "install dccp /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
4.6.2 Disable SCTP (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to 
support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one 
connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is 
message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with 
congestion control like TCP. 
Rationale: 
If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, 
disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if SCTP is disabled. 
# grep "install sctp /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
install sctp /bin/true  
Remediation: 
# echo "install sctp /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
4.6.3 Disable RDS (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol is a transport layer protocol designed to 
provide low-latency, high-bandwidth communications between cluster nodes. It was 
developed by the Oracle Corporation. 
Rationale: 
If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, 
disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if RDS is disabled. 
# grep "install rds /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
install rds /bin/true 
Remediation: 
# echo "install rds /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
4.6.4 Disable TIPC (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to provide 
communication between cluster nodes. 
Rationale: 
If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, 
disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if TIPC is disabled. 
# grep "install tipc /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
install tipc /bin/true  
Remediation: 
# echo "install tipc /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf 
4.7 Enable firewalld (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
IPtables is an application that allows a system administrator to configure the IP tables, 
chains and rules provided by the Linux kernel firewall.  The firewalld service provides a 
dynamic firewall allowing changes to be made at anytime without disruptions cause by 
reloading. 
Rationale: 
A firewall provides extra protection for the Linux system by limiting communications in 
and out of the box to specific addresses and ports. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if firewalld is enabled: 
# systemctl is-enabled firewalld 
enabled 
Remediation: 
# systemctl enable firewalld 
5 Logging and Auditing 
The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, 
using tools included with RHEL7. 
It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing 
summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing 
summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious 
system behavior. 
In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended 
that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an 
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that 
may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log 
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the 
local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it 
to process the logs described in this section. 
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems 
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized 
among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol 
for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most 
network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring 
NTP. 
It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and 
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more 
significant when compared to an entry in another log. 
Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the 
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who 
are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in 
order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have 
group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. 
Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for 
systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to 
read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are 
designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in 
some cases wheel). 
5.1 Configure rsyslog 
The rsyslog software is recommended as a replacement for the default syslogd daemon and 
provides improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission 
of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a 
central logging server. 
5.1.1 Install the rsyslog package (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The rsyslog package is a third party package that provides many enhancements to syslog, 
such as multi-threading, TCP communication, message filtering and data base support. As 
of RHEL 5.2, rsyslog is available as part of the core distribution. 
Rationale: 
The security enhancements of rsyslog such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission 
of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a 
central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package. 
Audit: 
Perform the following command to verify that rsyslog is installed. 
# rpm -q rsyslog 
rsyslog.<package version>.<hardware platform> 
Remediation: 
# yum install rsyslog 
5.1.2 Activate the rsyslog Service (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The systemctl command can be used to ensure that the rsyslog service is turned on. 
Rationale: 
If the rsyslog service is not activated the system will not have a syslog service running. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if rsyslog is enabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled rsyslog 
enabled 
Remediation: 
# systemctl enable rsyslog 
5.1.3 Configure /etc/rsyslog.conf (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/rsyslog.conf file specifies rules for logging and which files are to be used to log 
certain classes of messages. 
Rationale: 
A great deal of important security-related information is sent via rsyslog (e.g., successful 
and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.). 
Audit: 
Review the contents of the /etc/rsyslog.conf file to ensure appropriate logging is set. In 
addition, perform the following command and ensure that the log files are logging 
information: 
# ls -l /var/log/  
Remediation: 
Edit the following lines in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file as appropriate for your 
environment: 
auth,user.* /var/log/messages 
kern.* /var/log/kern.log 
daemon.* /var/log/daemon.log 
syslog.* /var/log/syslog 
lpr,news,uucp,local0,local1,local2,local3,local4,local5,local6.* /var/log/unused.log 
# Execute the following command to restart rsyslogd 
# pkill -HUP rsyslogd 
References: 
1.  See the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information. 
5.1.4 Create and Set Permissions on rsyslog Log Files (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
A log file must already exist for rsyslog to be able to write to it. 
Rationale: 
It is important to ensure that log files exist and have the correct permissions to ensure that 
sensitive rsyslog data is archived and protected. 
Audit: 
For each <logfile> listed in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file, perform the following command 
and verify that the <owner>:<group> is root:root and the permissions are 0600 (for sites 
that have not implemented a secure group) and root:securegrp with permissions of 0640 
(for sites that have implemented a secure group): 
# ls -l <logfile>  
Remediation: 
For sites that have not implemented a secure admin group: 
Create the /var/log/ directory and for each <logfile> listed in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file, 
perform the following commands: 
# touch <logfile> 
# chown root:root <logfile> 
# chmod og-rwx <logfile>  
For sites that have implemented a secure admin group: 
Create the /var/log/ directory and for each <logfile> listed in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file, 
perform the following commands (where is the name of the security group): 
# touch <logfile> 
# chown root:<securegrp> <logfile> 
# chmod g-wx,o-rwx<logfile>  
References: 
1.  See the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information. 
5.1.5 Configure rsyslog to Send Logs to a Remote Log Host (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The rsyslog utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host running 
syslogd(8) or to receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead. 
Rationale: 
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker 
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is 
stored on the local system 
Audit: 
Review the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and verify that logs are sent to a central host (where 
logfile.example.com is the name of your central log host). 
# grep "^*.*[^I][^I]*@" /etc/rsyslog.conf 
*.* @@loghost.example.com  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and add the following line (where logfile.example.com is 
the name of your central log host). 
*.* @@loghost.example.com 
# Execute the following command to restart rsyslogd 
# pkill -HUP rsyslogd  
Note: The double "at" sign (@@) directs rsyslog to use TCP to send log messages to the 
server, which is a more reliable transport mechanism than the default UDP protocol. 
References: 
1.  See the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information. 
5.1.6 Accept Remote rsyslog Messages Only on Designated Log Hosts 
(Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The 
ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via 
TCP. The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP 
port. 
Rationale: 
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept 
rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not 
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides 
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing 
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location. 
Audit: 
Run the following to determine if rsyslog is listening for remote messages: 
# grep '$ModLoad imtcp.so' /etc/rsyslog.conf 
$ModLoad imtcp.so 
# grep '$InputTCPServerRun' /etc/rsyslog.conf 
$InputTCPServerRun 514 
Remediation: 
On hosts that are designated as log hosts edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and un-comment 
the following lines: 
$ModLoad imtcp.so 
$InputTCPServerRun 514 
Note: On hosts that are not designated log hosts these lines should be commented out 
instead. 
Execute the following command to restart rsyslogd: 
# pkill -HUP rsyslogd 
References: 
1.  See the rsyslog(8) man page for more information. 
5.2 Configure System Accounting (auditd) 
System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems 
such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd 
will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication 
events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events 
will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are 
captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. 
Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one 
for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. 
5.2.1 Configure Data Retention 
When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit 
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. 
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may 
fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide 
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements. 
5.2.1.1 Configure Audit Log Storage Size (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it 
will be rotated and a new log file will be started. 
Rationale: 
It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact 
the system and audit data is not lost. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine the maximum size of the audit log files.  
# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
max_log_file = <MB> 
Remediation: 
Set the max_log_file parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
max_log_file = <MB>  
Note: MB is the number of MegaBytes the file can be. 
5.2.1.2 Disable System on Audit Log Full (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
The auditd daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full. 
Rationale: 
In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation 
exceeds the benefit of the system's availability. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if auditd is configured to notify the administrator and 
halt the system when audit logs are full. 
# grep space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
space_left_action = email 
# grep action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
action_mail_acct = root 
# grep admin_space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
admin_space_left_action = halt 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file. 
space_left_action = email 
action_mail_acct = root 
admin_space_left_action = halt  
5.2.1.3 Keep All Auditing Information (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Normally, auditd will hold 4 logs of maximum log file size before deleting older log files. 
Rationale: 
In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of 
storing the audit history. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if audit logs are retained. 
# grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
max_log_file_action = keep_logs 
Remediation: 
Add the following line to the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file. 
max_log_file_action = keep_logs  
5.2.2 Enable auditd Service (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Turn on the auditd daemon to record system events. 
Rationale: 
The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow 
them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if auditd is enabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled auditd 
enabled 
Remediation: 
# systemctl enable auditd 
5.2.3 Enable Auditing for Processes That Start Prior to auditd (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Configure grub so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if 
they start up prior to auditd startup. 
Rationale: 
Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that 
potential malicious activity cannot go undetected. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if /boot/grub2/grub.cfg is configured to log 
processes that start prior to auditd. 
# grep "linux" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
Make sure each line that starts with linux has the audit=1 parameter set. 
Remediation: 
Edit /etc/default/grub to include audit=1 as part of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1" 
And run the following command to update the grub configuration: 
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
5.2.4 Record Events That Modify Date and Time Information (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Capture events where the system date and/or time has been modified. The parameters in 
this section are set to determine if the adjtimex (tune kernel clock), settimeofday (Set 
time, using timeval and timezone structures) stime (using seconds since 1/1/1970) or 
clock_settime (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls 
have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log file upon 
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change" 
Rationale: 
Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the 
system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if events where the system date and/or time has been 
modified are captured. 
On a 64 bit system, perform the following command and ensure the output is as 
shown.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep time-change /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change 
On a 32 bit system, perform the following command and ensure the output is as 
shown.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep time-change /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change 
Remediation: 
For 64 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1 -HUP auditd 
For 32 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change 
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1 -HUP auditd  
5.2.5 Record Events That Modify User/Group Information (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Record events affecting the group, passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or 
/etc/security/opasswd (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM 
configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have 
been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with 
the identifier "identity" in the audit log file. 
Rationale: 
Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been 
compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or 
compromise additional accounts. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if events that modify user/group information are 
recorded. 
# grep identity /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /etc/group -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/gshadow -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/security/opasswd -p wa -k identity 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /etc/group -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/gshadow -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity 
-w /etc/security/opasswd -p wa -k identity 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1-HUP auditd 
5.2.6 Record Events That Modify the System's Network Environment 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters 
monitor the sethostname (set the system's host name) or setdomainname (set the system's 
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other 
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed pre-
login), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and 
/etc/sysconfig/network (directory containing network interface scripts and 
configurations) files. 
Rationale: 
Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes 
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break 
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored 
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change 
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to 
unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as 
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing 
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can 
show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the 
machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the 
identifier "system-locale." 
Audit: 
On a 64 bit system, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown 
to determine if events that modify the system's environment are recorded.  Note: "-a 
always,exit" may be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep system-locale /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k system-locale  
For 32 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if events that modify the system's environment are recorded.  Note: "-a 
always,exit" may be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep system-locale /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k system-locale 
Remediation: 
For 64 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k system-locale 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1-HUP auditd  
For 32 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale 
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k system-locale 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1-HUP auditd 
5.2.7 Record Events That Modify the System's Mandatory Access 
Controls (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor SELinux mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor any write 
access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or attribute 
changes to the /etc/selinux directory. 
Rationale: 
Changes to files in this directory could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting to 
modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the 
system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if events that modify the system's mandatory access 
controls are recorded 
# grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy 
Execute the following command to restart auditd: 
# pkill -P 1 -HUP auditd 
5.2.8 Collect Login and Logout Events (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor login and logout events. The parameters below track changes to files associated 
with login/logout events. The file /var/log/faillog tracks failed events from login. The 
file /var/log/lastlog maintain records of the last time a user successfully logged in. The 
file /var/log/btmp keeps track of failed login attempts and can be read by entering the 
command /usr/bin/last -f /var/log/btmp. All audit records will be tagged with the 
identifier "logins." 
Rationale: 
Monitoring login/logout events could provide a system administrator with information 
associated with brute force attacks against user logins. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if login and logout events are recorded. 
# grep logins /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins 
-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins 
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins 
-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins 
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd 
5.2.9 Collect Session Initiation Information (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files 
associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp file tracks all currently logged in 
users. The /var/log/wtmp file tracks logins, logouts, shutdown and reboot events. All audit 
records will be tagged with the identifier "session." 
Rationale: 
Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at 
unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when 
they do not normally log in). 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if session initiation information is collected. 
# grep session /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session 
-w /var/log/wtmp -p wa -k session 
-w /var/log/btmp -p wa -k session 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session 
-w /var/log/wtmp -p wa -k session 
-w /var/log/btmp -p wa -k session  
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd  
Note: Use the last command to read /var/log/wtmp (last with no parameters) and 
/var/run/utmp (last -f /var/run/utmp) 
5.2.10 Collect Discretionary Access Control Permission Modification 
Events (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in 
this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The 
chmod, fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The 
chown, fchown, fchownat and lchown system calls affect owner and group attributes on a 
file. The setxattr, lsetxattr, fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr, 
lremovexattr, fremovexattr (remove extended file attributes) control extended file 
attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system userids (auid >= 
1000) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be 
tagged with the identifier "perm_mod." 
Rationale: 
Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to activity that 
could indicate intruder activity or policy violation. 
Audit: 
For 64 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if permission modifications are being recorded.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be 
specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep perm_mod /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chmod -S fchmod -S fchmodat -F auid>=1000 \

lremovexattr -S fremovexattr -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod  
For 32 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if permission modifications are being recorded.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be 
specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep perm_mod /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S chmod -S fchmod -S fchmodat -F auid>=1000 \

5.2.11 Collect Unsuccessful Unauthorized Access Attempts to Files 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor for unsuccessful attempts to access files. The parameters below are associated 
with system calls that control creation (creat), opening (open, openat) and truncation 
(truncate, ftruncate) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a non-
privileged user (auid > = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the 
system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other 
permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged 
with the identifier "access." 
Rationale: 
Failed attempts to open, create or truncate files could be an indication that an individual or 
process is trying to gain unauthorized access to the system. 
Audit: 
On 64 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if there are unsuccessful attempts to access files.  Note: "-a always,exit" may 
be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep access /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate -S ftruncate \ 
-F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access

-F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access  
On 32 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if there are unsuccessful attempts to access files.  Note: "-a always,exit" may 
be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep access /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate -S ftruncate \ 
-F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access

-F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access 
Remediation: 
For 64 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate -S ftruncate \ 
-F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access

# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd 
5.2.12 Collect Use of Privileged Commands (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid bit set on execution) 
to determine if unprivileged users are running these commands. 
Rationale: 
Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an indication of 
someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system. 
Audit: 
Verify that an audit line for each setuid/setgid program identified in the find command 
appears in the audit file with the above attributes. 
Remediation: 
locate all the privileged programs and then add an audit line for each one of them. The 
audit parameters associated with this are as follows: 
-F path=" $1 " - will populate each file name found through the find command and 
processed by awk. 
-F perm=x - will write an audit record if the file is executed. 
-F auid>=1000 - will write a record if the user executing the command is not a privileged 
user. 
-F auid!= 4294967295 - will ignore Daemon events 
All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "privileged." 
# find PART -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk '{print \ 
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \ 
-k privileged" }' 
Next, add those lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
5.2.13 Collect Successful File System Mounts (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount) system call controls the 
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to 
create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user 
Rationale: 
It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While 
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media 
may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's 
an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the 
media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also 
have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a 
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair 
indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track 
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the 
audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track 
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document. 
have to come from external media and this action still does not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS) 
Audit: 
For 64 bit systems perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if filesystem mounts are recorded.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be specified as 
"-a exit,always". 
# grep mounts /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
For 32 bit systems perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if filesystem mounts are recorded.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be specified as 
"-a exit,always". 
# grep mounts /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
Remediation: 
For 64 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd  
For 32 bit systems, add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd 
5.2.14 Collect File Deletion Events by User (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file 
attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file), 
unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file 
attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete". 
Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator 
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with 
protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system 
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or 
altered. 
Audit: 
For 64 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if file deletion events by user are recorded. 
# grep delete /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete  
For 32 bit systems, perform the following command and ensure the output is as shown to 
determine if file deletion events by user are recorded. 
# grep delete /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete 
Remediation: 
At a minimum, configure the audit system to collect file deletion events for all users and 
root. 
For 64 bit systems, add the following to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd 
For 32 bit systems, add the following to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=1000 \ 
-F auid!=4294967295 -k delete 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -P 1-HUP auditd 
5.2.15 Collect Changes to System Administration Scope (sudoers) 
(Scored) 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly 
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the 
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope. 
The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The 
audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope." 
Rationale: 
Changes in the /etc/sudoers file can indicate that an unauthorized change has been made 
to scope of system administrator activity. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if changes to /etc/sudoers are recorded. 
# grep scope /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope  
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd 
5.2.16 Collect System Administrator Actions (sudolog) (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of 
the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to 
execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to 
/var/log/sudo.log. Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as 
command will be written to the log. 
Rationale: 
Changes in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or 
the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events 
written to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if 
unauthorized commands have been executed. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if administrator activity is recorded. 
# grep actions /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions 
# Execute the following command to restart auditd 
# pkill -HUP -P 1 auditd  
Note: The system must be configured with su disabled (See Item 7.6 Restrict Access to the 
su Command) to force all command execution through sudo. This will not be effective on 
the console, as administrators can log in as root. 
5.2.17 Collect Kernel Module Loading and Unloading (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a 
kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated 
program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and 
unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a 
module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the 
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with 
an identifier of "modules". 
Rationale: 
with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly 
compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and 
delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a 
different program to load and unload modules. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if kernel module loading and unloading is 
recorded.  Note: "-a always,exit" may be specified as "-a exit,always". 
# grep modules /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-w /sbin/insmod -p x -k modules 
-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -k modules 
-w /sbin/modprobe -p x -k modules 
For 32 bit systems 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules 
For 64 bit systems 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules 
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-w /sbin/insmod -p x -k modules 
-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -k modules 
-w /sbin/modprobe -p x -k modules 
For 32 bit systems, add 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules 
For 64 bit systems, add 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules 
5.2.18 Make the Audit Configuration Immutable (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl. Setting the flag "-e 
2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made on system 
reboot. 
Rationale: 
In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to 
potential hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. Users would most likely 
unauthorized audit changes. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the audit configuration is immutable. 
# grep "^-e 2" /etc/audit/audit.rules 
-e 2  
Remediation: 
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file. 
-e 2  
Note: This must be the last entry in the /etc/audit/audit.rules file 
5.3 Configure logrotate (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the 
system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large. The file 
/etc/logrotate.d/syslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by 
syslog or rsyslog. These files are rotated on a weekly basis via a cron job and the last 4 
weeks are kept. 
Rationale: 
By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily 
archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately 
large log files. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the appropriate system logs are rotated. 
# grep '{' /etc/logrotate.d/syslog 
/var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler /var/log/boot.log 
/var/log/cron { 
Edit the /etc/logrotate.d/syslog file to include appropriate system logs: 
/var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler /var/log/boot.log 
/var/log/cron { 
6 System Access, Authentication and Authorization 
6.1 Configure cron and anacron 
6.1.1 Enable anacron Daemon (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The anacron daemon is used on systems that are not up 24x7. The anacron daemon will 
execute jobs that would have normally been run had the system not been down. 
Rationale: 
Cron jobs may include critical security or administrative functions that need to run on a 
regular basis. Use this daemon on machines that are not up 24x7, or if there are jobs that 
need to be executed after the system has been brought back up after a maintenance 
window. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if anacron is enabled. 
# rpm -q cronie-anacron 
cronie-anacron.<package version>.<hardware platform> 
Remediation: 
# yum install cronie-anacron 
Note: NSA Guidance recommends disabling anacron for systems that are intended to be up 
24X7, with the rationale that unnecessary software should be disabled to reduce risk. 
However, even systems that are designed to be up at all times can experience downtime 
requirements for your site to determine your appropriate risk level. 
6.1.2 Enable crond Daemon (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The crond daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system. 
Rationale: 
While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have 
maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run and crond is used 
to execute them. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if cron is enabled. 
# systemctl is-enabled crond 
enabled 
Remediation: 
# systemctl enable crond 
6.1.3 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/anacrontab (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/anacrontab file is used by anacron to control its own jobs. The commands in 
this item make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and is the only user 
that can read and write the file. 
Rationale: 
This file contains information on what system jobs are run by anacron. Write access to 
these files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read 
run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/anacrontab file has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/anacrontab | egrep ".00 0 0" 
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/anacrontab 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/anacrontab 
6.1.4 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/crontab (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item 
make here sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and is the only user that 
can read and write the file. 
Rationale: 
This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these 
files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read 
access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that 
run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/crontab file has the correct permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/crontab | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/crontab 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on an hourly basis. The files in 
this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by 
system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and 
search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this 
directory. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/cron.hourly file has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/cron.hourly | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/cron.hourly 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.hourly 
6.1.6 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.daily (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/cron.daily directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a daily 
basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are 
instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict 
accessing this directory. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/cron.daily directory has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/cron.daily | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/cron.daily 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.daily 
6.1.7 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.weekly 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/cron.weekly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a weekly 
basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are 
instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict 
read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from 
accessing this directory. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/cron.weekly directory has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/cron.weekly | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/cron.weekly 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.weekly 
6.1.8 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.monthly 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/cron.monthly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a monthly 
basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are 
instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict 
read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from 
accessing this directory. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/cron.monthly directory has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/cron.monthly | egrep ".00 0 0" 
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.monthly 
6.1.9 Set User/Group Owner and Permission on /etc/cron.d (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/cron.d directory contains system cron jobs that need to run in a similar manner 
to the hourly, daily weekly and monthly jobs from /etc/crontab, but require more 
granular control as to when they run. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by 
the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. 
The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, 
preventing regular users from accessing this directory. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the /etc/cron.d directory has the correct 
permissions. 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/cron.d | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# chown root:root /etc/cron.d 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.d 
6.1.10 Restrict at Daemon (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
time only jobs at their convenience. There are two files that control at: /etc/at.allow and 
/etc/at.deny. If /etc/at.allow exists, then users listed in the file are the only ones that 
can create at jobs. If /etc/at.allow does not exist and /etc/at.deny does exist, then any 
user on the system, with the exception of those listed in /etc/at.deny, are allowed to 
execute at jobs. An empty /etc/at.deny file allows any user to create at jobs. If neither 
/etc/at.allow nor /etc/at.deny exist, then only superuser can create at jobs. The 
commands below remove the /etc/at.deny file and create an empty /etc/at.allow file 
that can only be read and modified by user and group root. 
Rationale: 
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the 
means to gain unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory 
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent 
auditing controls. In addition, it is a better practice to create a white list of users who can 
execute at jobs versus a blacklist of users who can't execute at jobs as a system 
administrator will always know who can create jobs and does not have to worry about 
remembering to add a user to the blacklist when a new user id is created. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if at jobs are restricted. 
# stat -L /etc/at.deny > /dev/null 
# stat -L -c "%a %u %g" /etc/at.allow | egrep ".00 0 0"  
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended. 
Remediation: 
# rm /etc/at.deny 
# touch /etc/at.allow 
# chown root:root /etc/at.allow 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/at.allow 
6.1.11 Restrict at/cron to Authorized Users (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Configure /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use these 
services. If /etc/cron.allow or /etc/at.allow do not exist, then /etc/at.deny and 
use at and cron. By removing the files, only users in /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow 
are allowed to use at and cron. Note that even though a given user is not listed in 
cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user. The cron.allow file only controls 
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs. 
Rationale: 
On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using 
the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to 
manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to 
the system and forget to add it to the deny files. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the remediation in the section has been performed: 
# ls -l /etc/cron.deny 
[no output returned] 
# ls -l /etc/at.deny 
[no output returned] 
# ls -l /etc/cron.allow 
-rw------- 1 root root /etc/cron.allow 
# ls -l /etc/at.allow 
-rw------- 1 root root /etc/at.allow 
Remediation: 
If /etc/cron.allow or /etc/at.allow do not exist on your system create them. 
Run the following to ensure cron.deny and at.deny are removed and permissions are set 
correctly: 
# /bin/rm /etc/cron.deny 
# /bin/rm /etc/at.deny 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.allow 
# chmod og-rwx /etc/at.allow 
# chown root:root /etc/cron.allow 
# chown root:root /etc/at.allow 
Description: SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as 
telnet, ftp, rlogin, rsh, and rcp.  
Rationale: It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols 
and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  
6.2.1 Set SSH Protocol to 2 (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
SSH supports two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2. SSH1 was the 
original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced and secure. 
Rationale: 
SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^Protocol" /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Protocol 2  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
Protocol 2 
6.2.2 Set Level to INFO (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged. 
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically 
not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides 
so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. INFO level is the 
basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident 
Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The 
logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^Level" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
Level INFO 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
Level INFO 
6.2.3 Set Permissions on /etc/ssh/sshd_config (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file contains configuration specifications for sshd. The 
command below sets the owner and group of the file to root. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-
privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-
privileged programs. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the user and group ownership on the 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config file. 
-rw------- 1 root root 762 Sep 23 002 /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Remediation: 
If the user and group ownership of the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file are incorrect, run the 
following command to correct them: 
# chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
If the permissions are incorrect, run the following command to correct them: 
# chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
6.2.4 Disable SSH X11 Forwarding (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the 
connection to enable remote graphic connections. 
Rationale: 
Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications 
directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via 
SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note 
that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^X11Forwarding" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
X11Forwarding no 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
X11Forwarding no  
6.2.5 Set SSH MaxAuthTries to 4 or Less (Scored) 
Level 1 
Description: 
The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts 
permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error 
messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure. 
Rationale: 
Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful 
brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, it is set the 
number based on site policy. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^MaxAuthTries" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
MaxAuthTries 4 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
MaxAuthTries 4 
6.2.6 Set SSH IgnoreRhosts to Yes (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The IgnoreRhosts parameter specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files will not be used in 
RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication. 
Rationale: 
Setting this parameter forces users to enter a password when authenticating with ssh. 
Audit: 
as shown: 
# grep "^IgnoreRhosts" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
IgnoreRhosts yes 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
IgnoreRhosts yes 
6.2.7 Set SSH HostbasedAuthentication to No (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through 
trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public 
key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2. 
Rationale: 
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, 
disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection . 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^HostbasedAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
HostbasedAuthentication no 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
HostbasedAuthentication no 
6.2.8 Disable SSH Root Login (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1
Description: 
The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh(1). The 
default is no. 
Rationale: 
Disallowing root logins over SSH requires server admins to authenticate using their own 
individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su. This in turn limits opportunity 
for non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
PermitRootLogin no 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
PermitRootLogin no 
6.2.9 Set SSH PermitEmptyPasswords to No (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the server allows login to accounts with 
empty password strings. 
Rationale: 
Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the 
probability of unauthorized access to the system 
Audit: 
as shown: 
# grep "^PermitEmptyPasswords" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
PermitEmptyPasswords no 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
PermitEmptyPasswords no 
6.2.10 Do Not Allow Users to Set Environment Options (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the 
ssh daemon. 
Rationale: 
Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could 
potentially allow users to bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has 
ssh executing trojaned programs). 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep PermitUserEnvironment /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
PermitUserEnvironment no  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
PermitUserEnvironment no  
6.2.11 Use Only Approved Cipher in Counter Mode (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1
Description: 
This variable limits the types of ciphers that SSH can use during communication. 
Rationale: 
Based on research conducted at various institutions, it was determined that the symmetric 
portion of the SSH Transport Protocol (as described in RFC 4253) has security weaknesses 
that allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was 
encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) method. From that research, new Counter 
mode algorithms (as described in RFC4344) were designed that are not vulnerable to these 
types of attacks and these algorithms are now recommended for standard use. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "Ciphers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr 
References: 
1.  For more information on the Counter mode algorithms, read RFC4344 at 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4344.txt. 
6.2.12 Set Idle Timeout Interval for User Login (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of 
ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no 
activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax 
interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response 
from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is 
set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be 
terminated after 45 seconds of idle time. 
Rationale: 
Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user 
access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't 
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. 
While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on 
site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client 
session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be 
sent. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^ClientAliveInterval" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
ClientAliveInterval 300 
# grep "^ClientAliveCountMax" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
ClientAliveCountMax 0 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
ClientAliveInterval 300 
ClientAliveCountMax 0  
6.2.13 Limit Access via SSH (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system 
via SSH. It is recommended that at least of the following options be leveraged: 
AllowUsers 
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric 
userIDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict 
user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the 
entry can be specified in the form of user@host. 
AllowGroups 
The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific 
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. 
Numeric groupIDs are not recognized with this variable. 
DenyUsers 
The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific 
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric 
userIDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict 
user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry 
can be specified in the form of user@host. 
DenyGroups 
The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific 
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names. 
Numeric groupIDs are not recognized with this variable. 
Rationale: 
Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only 
authorized users access the system. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is 
as shown: 
# grep "^AllowUsers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
AllowUsers <userlist> 
# grep "^AllowGroups" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
AllowGroups <grouplist> 
# grep "^DenyUsers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
DenyUsers <userlist> 
# grep "^DenyGroups" /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
DenyGroups <grouplist>  
Remediation: 
AllowUsers <userlist> 
AllowGroups <grouplist> 
DenyUsers <userlist> 
DenyGroups <grouplist> 
6.2.14 Set SSH Banner (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user 
before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed. 
Rationale: 
Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding 
connection. Consult with your legal department for the appropriate warning banner for 
your site. 
Audit: 
To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that <bannerfile> 
is either /etc/issue or /etc/issue.net: 
# grep "^Banner" /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Banner <bannerfile>  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: 
Banner /etc/issue.net 
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular 
authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects 
that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM 
are typically located in the /etc/pam.d directory. PAM must be carefully configured to 
secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other 
PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities. 
6.3.1 Upgrade Password Hashing Algorithm to SHA-512 (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The SHA-512 encryption has been available since Red Hat release 5.2,. The commands 
below change password encryption from md5 to sha512 (a much stronger hashing 
algorithm). All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to upgrade the 
stored hashes to the new algorithm. 
Rationale: 
The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing 
additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to 
successfully determine passwords. 
Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine if the password-hashing algorithm is set to SHA-512: 
# authconfig --test | grep hashing | grep sha512 
If the above command emits no output then the system is not configured as recommended 
Remediation: 
Perform the following to configure the system as recommended: 
# authconfig --passalgo=sha512 --update 
Note: If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is 
changed, it is recommended that all userID's be immediately expired and forced to change 
Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the 
system administrator to prevent any potential problems. 
# cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '( $3 >=1000 && $1 != "nfsnobody" ) { print $1 }' | xargs 
-n 1 chage -d 0 
6.3.2 Set Password Creation Requirement Parameters Using 
pam_pwquality (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The pam_pwquality module checks of the strength of passwords. It performs checks such 
as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of 
characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of 
the pam_pwquality.so options. 
   try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If 
 ot available, then prompt the user for a password. 
   retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure. 
 he following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file: 
   minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more 
   dcredit=-1 - provide at least 1 digit 
   ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character 
   ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character 
   lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character 
The setting shown above is one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own 
organization's password policies. 
Rationale: 
Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine the current settings in the /etc/pam.d/system-
auth file. 
password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 
authtok_type= 
Check settings in /etc/security/pwquality.conf: 
minlen=14 
dcredit=-1 
ucredit=-1 
ocredit=-1 
lcredit=-1 
Remediation: 
Set the pam_pwquality.so parameters as follows in /etc/pam.d/system-auth: 
password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 
authtok_type= 
Set the following settings in /etc/security/pwquality.conf: 
minlen=14 
dcredit=-1 
ucredit=-1 
ocredit=-1 
lcredit=-1 
6.3.3 Set Lockout for Failed Password Attempts (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Lock out userIDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes 
are made to the main PAM configuration files /etc/pam.d/system-auth and 
/etc/pam.d/password-auth. The second set of changes are applied to the program specific 
PAM configuration file (in this case, the ssh daemon). The second set of changes must be 
applied to each program that will lock out userID's. 
Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site. 
Rationale: 
Locking out userIDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force 
password attacks against your systems. 
Perform the following to determine the current settings for userID lockout. 
# grep "pam_faillock" /etc/pam.d/password-auth 
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

# grep "pam_unix.so" /etc/pam.d/system-auth | grep success=1 
auth [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files and add the 
"auth" lines as highlighted below: 
# cat /etc/pam.d/password-auth 
#%PAM-1.0

auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=5 unlock_time=900 
auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc audit deny=5 unlock_time=900 
auth required pam_deny.so 
Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive 
failure count defined by deny= in the pam_faillock.so module, the user can be unlocked 
by issuing the command /usr/sbin/faillock -u --reset. This command sets the failed 
count to 0, effectively unlocking the userid. 
6.3.4 Limit Password Reuse (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
The /etc/security/opasswd file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to 
ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords. 
Rationale: 
Forcing users not to reuse their past 5 passwords make it less likely that an attacker will be 
able to guess the password. 
Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system. 
Audit: 
Perform the following to determine the current setting for reuse of older passwords: 
# grep "remember" /etc/pam.d/system-auth 
password sufficient pam_unix.so remember=5 
Remediation: 
Set the pam_unix.so remember parameter to 5 in /etc/pam.d/system-auth: 
password sufficient pam_unix.so remember=5 
6.4 Restrict root Login to System Console (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The file /etc/securetty contains a list of valid terminals that may be logged in directly as 
root. 
Rationale: 
Since the system console has special properties to handle emergency situations, it is 
important to ensure that the console is in a physically secure location and that 
unauthorized consoles have not been defined. 
Audit: 
# cat /etc/securetty 
Remediation: 
6.5 Restrict Access to the su Command (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program 
has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged 
access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the 
pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the 
wheel group to execute su. 
Rationale: 
Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better 
control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility 
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed 
via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program. 
Audit: 
# grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su 
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid 
# grep wheel /etc/group 
wheel:x:10:root, <user list> 
Remediation: 
Set the pam_wheel.so parameters as follows in /etc/pam.d/su: 
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid 
Set the proper list of users to be included in the wheel group in /etc/groups. 
This section provides guidance on setting up secure defaults for system and user accounts 
and their environment. Guidance for monitoring these settings and others that may change 
over time is provided in Section 10 System Maintenance. 
7.1 Set Shadow Password Suite Parameters (/etc/login.defs) 
While a majority of the password control parameters have been moved to PAM, some 
parameters are still available through the shadow password suite. Any changes made to 
/etc/login.defs will only be applied if the usermod command is used. If userIDs are 
added a different way, use the chage command to effect changes to individual userIDs. 
7.1.1 Set Password Expiration Days (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force 
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the 
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days. 
Rationale: 
The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or 
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of 
the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an 
attacker's window of opportunity. 
Audit: 
# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs 
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 
# chage --list <user> 
Maximum number of days between password change:    90 
Remediation: 
Set the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter to 90 in /etc/login.defs: 
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 
Modify active user parameters to match: 
7.1.2 Set Password Change Minimum Number of Days (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent 
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the 
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS 
parameter be set to 7 or more days. 
Rationale: 
By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from 
repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls. 
Audit: 
# grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs 
PASS_MAX_DAYS 7 
# chage --list <user> 
Minimum number of days between password change:    7 
Remediation: 
Set the PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs: 
PASS_MIN_DAYS 7 
Modify active user parameters to match: 
# chage --mindays 7 <user> 
7.1.3 Set Password Expiring Warning Days (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users 
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the 
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days. 
Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of 
a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down 
where it may be discovered. 
Audit: 
# grep PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs 
PASS_WARN_AGE 7 
# chage --list <user> 
Number of days of warning before password expires:    7 
Remediation: 
Set the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs: 
PASS_WARN_AGE 7 
Modify active user parameters to match: 
# chage --warndays 7 <user> 
7.2 Disable System Accounts (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
There are a number of accounts provided with the Red Hat that are used to manage 
applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell. 
Rationale: 
It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are 
locked to prevent them from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, Red Hat 
sets the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended 
that the shell field in the password file be set to /sbin/nologin. This prevents the account 
from potentially being used to run any commands. 
Audit: 
Run the following script to determine if any system accounts can be accessed: 
egrep -v "^\+" /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" && $1!="shutdown" && 
$1!="halt" && $3<1000 && $7!="/sbin/nologin") {print}' 
Remediation: 
Accounts that have been locked are prohibited from running commands on the 
system.  Such accounts are not able to login to the system nor are they able to use 
scheduled execution facilities such as cron.  To make sure system accounts cannot be 
accessed, using the following script: 
#!/bin/bash 
for user in `awk -F: '($3 < 1000) {print $1 }' /etc/passwd`; do 
   if [ $user != "root" ] 
   then 
      /usr/sbin/usermod -L $user 
      if [ $user != "sync" ] && [ $user != "shutdown" ] && [ $user != "halt" ] 
      then 
         /usr/sbin/usermod -s /sbin/nologin $user 
      fi 
   fi 
done 
7.3 Set Default Group for root Account (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This 
affects permissions of files that are created by the root user. 
Rationale: 
Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root-owned files from accidentally 
becoming accessible to non-privileged users. 
Audit: 
# grep "^root:" /etc/passwd | cut -f4 -d: 
0 
Remediation: 
# usermod -g 0 root 
7.4 Set Default umask for Users (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1
Description: 
The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating 
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the 
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by 
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command 
into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.) in their home directories. 
Rationale: 
Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice 
about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories 
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would 
make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 
would make files readable by every user on the system. 
Note: The directives in this section apply to bash and shell. If other shells are supported on 
the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are checked.  
Audit: 
# grep "^umask 077" /etc/bashrc 
umask 077 
# grep "^umask 077" /etc/profile.d/* 
umask 077 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile.d/cis.sh files (and the appropriate files for any 
other shell supported on your system) and add the following the UMASK parameter as 
shown: 
umask 77 
7.5 Lock Inactive User Accounts (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 35 or more days be 
disabled.  
Rationale: 
Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to 
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies. 
Audit: 
# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE  
Remediation: 
# useradd -D -f 35 
8 Warning Banners 
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the prosecution of 
trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the 
side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from 
attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system. 
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages 
include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system 
is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and 
that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the 
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system 
modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More 
information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at 
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/  
Note: The text provided in the remediation actions for these items is intended as an 
example only. Please edit to include the specific text for your organization as approved by 
your legal department. 
8.1 Set Warning Banner for Standard Login Services (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
console and serial devices, and also prior to logins via telnet. The contents of the 
/etc/motd file is generally displayed after all successful logins, no matter where the user is 
logging in from, but is thought to be less useful because it only provides notification to the 
user after the machine has been accessed. 
Rationale: 
Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal 
status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the 
system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Consult with your organization's legal 
counsel for the appropriate wording for your specific organization. 
Audit: 
Run the following commands and ensure that the files exist and have the correct 
permissions. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/motd 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/motd 
# ls /etc/issue 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/issue 
# ls /etc/issue.net 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/issue.net  
The commands above simply validate the presence of the /etc/motd, /etc/issue and 
/etc/issue.net files. Review the contents of these files with the "cat" command and 
ensure that it is appropriate for your organization. 
Remediation: 
# touch /etc/motd 
# echo "Authorized uses only. All activity may be \ 
monitored and reported." > /etc/issue 
# echo "Authorized uses only. All activity may be \ 
monitored and reported." > /etc/issue.net 
# chown root:root /etc/motd 
# chmod 644 /etc/motd 
# chown root:root /etc/issue 
# chmod 644 /etc/issue 
# chown root:root /etc/issue.net 
# chmod 644 /etc/issue.net 
8.2 Remove OS Information from Login Warning Banners (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description:
Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch 
level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are 
developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following 
options, they display operating system information:  
\m - machine architecture (uname -m) 
\r - operating system release (uname -r) 
\s - operating system name 
\v - operating system version (uname -v) 
Rationale: 
Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of 
providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of 
a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the "uname -a" 
command once they have logged in. 
Audit: 
Perform the following commands to check if OS information is set to be displayed in the 
system login banners: 
# egrep '(\\v|\\r|\\m|\\s)' /etc/issue 
# egrep '(\\v|\\r|\\m|\\s)' /etc/motd 
# egrep'(\\v|\\r|\\m|\\s)' /etc/issue.net  
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc/motd, /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files and remove any lines 
containing \m, \r, \s or \v. 
8.3 Set GNOME Warning Banner (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The GNOME Display Manager is used for login session management. See the manual page 
gdm(1) for more information. The remediation action for this item sets a warning message 
for GDM users before they log in. 
Rationale:
Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal 
status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the 
system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Consult with your organization's legal 
counsel for the appropriate wording for your specific organization. 
Audit: 
Verify that a message is shown when logging in via the GNOME Display Manager. 
Remediation: 
Edit the /etc.d/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message file as to include the following: 
[org/gnome/login-screen] 
banner-message-enable=true 
banner-message-text='Type the banner message here'  
Run the following command to update dconf: 
dconf update  
Restart gdm for these settings to take effect. 
9 System Maintenance 
No matter how securely a system has been installed and hardened, administrator and user 
activity over time can introduce security exposures. The section describes tasks to be 
performed on a regular, ongoing basis - perhaps in an automated fashion via the cron 
utility. 
Note: unlike other sections, the items in this section specify an Audit action followed by a 
Remediation action since it is necessary to determine what the current setting is before 
determining remediation measures, which will vary depending on the site's policy. 
9.1 Verify System File Permissions 
9.1.1 Verify System File Permissions (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 2 
Description: 
verify) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The -V 
option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages (-Va). If 
no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the 
meaning of output from the verify option: 
Code Meaning  
S File size differs.  
M File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).  
5 The MD5 checksum differs.  
D The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.  
L A mismatch occurs in a link.  
U The file ownership differs.  
G The file group owner differs.  
T The file time (mtime) differs.  
The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs 
to. For example the following command determines which package the /etc/passwd file 
belongs to: 
# rpm -qf /etc/passwd 
setup-2.5.58-7.el5  
To verify the settings for the package that controls the /etc/passwd file, run the following: 
# rpm -V setup-2.5.58-7.el5 
.M...... c /etc/passwd 
S.5....T c /etc/printcap  
Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: 
# rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` 
.M...... c /etc/passwd 
S.5....T c /etc/printcap  
Rationale: 
It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with 
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor. 
Note: Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is 
recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time 
consuming task and is therefore not a scored benchmark item, but is provided for those 
interested in additional security measures. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very 
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that the 
output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later. 
# rpm -Va --nomtime --nosize --nomd5 --nolinkto > <filename> 
Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the command until output is clean or risk is 
mitigated or accepted.

9.1.2 Verify Permissions on /etc/passwd (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/passwd file contains user account information that is used by many system 
utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate. 
Rationale: 
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is protected from unauthorized write 
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either 
inadvertently or through malicious actions. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/passwd file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/passwd 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2055 Jan 30 16:30 /etc/passwd  
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/passwd file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 644 /etc/passwd  
9.1.3 Verify Permissions on /etc/shadow (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
The /etc/shadow file is used to store the information about user accounts that is critical to 
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security 
information. 
Rationale: 
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password 
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that 
is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the 
user accounts. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/shadow file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/shadow 
---------- 1 root root 633 Sep 23 2002 /etc/shadow 
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/shadow file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 000 /etc/shadow 
9.1.4 Verify Permissions on /etc/gshadow (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/gshadow file contains information about group accounts that is critical to the 
security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information. 
Rationale: 
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/gshadow file, they can easily run a password 
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that 
is stored in the /etc/gshadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the 
group accounts. 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/gshadow file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/gshadow 
---------- 1 root root 633 Sep 23 2002 /etc/gshadow  
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/gshadow file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 000 /etc/gshadow 
9.1.5 Verify Permissions on /etc/group (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/group file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The 
command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/group file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged 
users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged 
programs. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/group file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/group 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 762 Sep 23 002 /etc/group 
Remediation: 
If the permissions of the /etc/group file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chmod 644 /etc/group  
9.1.6 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/passwd (Scored) 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/passwd file contains a list of all the valid userIDs defined in the system, but not 
the passwords. The command below sets the owner and group of the file to root. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/passwd file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged 
users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged 
programs. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the user and group ownership on the 
/etc/passwd file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/passwd 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 762 Sep 23 002 /etc/passwd  
Remediation: 
If the user and group ownership of the /etc/passwd file are incorrect, run the following 
command to correct them: 
# /bin/chown root:root /etc/passwd  
9.1.7 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/shadow (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/shadow file contains the one-way cipher text passwords for each user defined in 
the /etc/passwd file. The command below sets the user and group ownership of the file to 
root. 
Rationale: 
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password 
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that 
user accounts. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/shadow file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/shadow 
---------- 1 root root 762 Sep 23 2002 /etc/shadow 
Remediation: 
If the ownership of the /etc/shadow file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chown root:root /etc/shadow 
9.1.8 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/gshadow (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/gshadow file contains information about group accounts that is critical to the 
security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information. 
Rationale: 
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/gshadow file, they can easily run a password 
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that 
is stored in the /etc/gshadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the 
group accounts. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/gshadow file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/gshadow 
---------- 1 root root 633 Sep 23 2002 /etc/gshadow 
Remediation: 
If the ownership of the /etc/gshadow file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
9.1.9 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/group (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The /etc/group file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The 
command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else. 
Rationale: 
The /etc/group file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-
privileged users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-
privileged programs. 
Audit: 
Run the following command to determine the permissions on the /etc/group file. 
# /bin/ls -l /etc/group 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 762 Sep 23 002 /etc/group  
Remediation: 
If the ownership of the /etc/group file are incorrect, run the following command to 
correct them: 
# /bin/chown root:root /etc/group 
9.1.10 Find World Writable Files (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files 
are the least secure. See the chmod(2) man page for more information. 
Rationale: 
World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could 
potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -
perm -0002 
Remediation: 
Removing write access for the "other" category (chmod o-w <filename>) is advisable, but 
always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application 
dependencies on a given file. 
9.1.11 Find Un-owned Files and Directories (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to 
remove all files owned by those users from the system. 
Rationale: 
A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up 
"owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nouser -
ls 
Remediation: 
Locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files, 
and reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system as appropriate. 
9.1.12 Find Un-grouped Files and Directories (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1
Description: 
Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to 
remove all files owned by those users from the system. 
Rationale: 
A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up 
"owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nogroup -
ls 
Remediation: 
Locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files, 
and reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system as appropriate. 
9.1.13 Find SUID System Executables (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's 
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the 
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform 
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges. 
Rationale: 
There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such 
programs to ensure they are legitimate. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -
perm -4000 -print 
Ensure that no rogue set-UID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the 
files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries 
as described below: 
# rpm -V `rpm -qf /usr/bin/sudo` 
.......T /usr/bin/sudo 
SM5....T /usr/bin/sudoedit 
9.1.14 Find SGID System Executables (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's 
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the 
group. The most common reason for a SGID program is to enable users to perform 
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges. 
Rationale: 
There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such 
programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit 
section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from 
the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced. The following is 
an example of checking the "sudo" executable: 
# rpm -V `rpm -qf /usr/bin/sudo` 
.......T /usr/bin/sudo 
SM5....T /usr/bin/sudoedit  
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -
perm -2000 -print 
Remediation: 
Ensure that no rogue set-GID programs have been introduced into the system 
# /bin/rpm -V `/bin/rpm -qf sudo` 
This section provides guidance on securing aspects of the users and groups. 
9.2.1 Ensure Password Fields are Not Empty (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user 
without providing a password. 
Rationale: 
All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by 
an unauthorized user. 
Audit: 
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned: 
# /bin/cat /etc/shadow | /bin/awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a 
password "}'  
Remediation: 
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following 
command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password: 
# /usr/bin/passwd -l <username> 
Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to 
determine if it needs to be forced off. 
9.2.2 Verify No Legacy "+" Entries Exist in /etc/passwd File (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
maps at a certain point in a system configuration file. These entries are no longer required 
on RHEL7 systems, but may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms. 
Rationale: 
These entries may provide an avenue for attackers to gain privileged access on the system. 
Audit: 
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned: 
# /bin/grep '^+:' /etc/passwd  
Remediation: 
Delete these entries if they exist. 
9.2.3 Verify No Legacy "+" Entries Exist in /etc/shadow File (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The character + in various files used to be markers for systems to insert data from NIS 
maps at a certain point in a system configuration file. These entries are no longer required 
on RHEL7 systems, but may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms. 
Rationale: 
These entries may provide an avenue for attackers to gain privileged access on the system. 
Audit: 
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned: 
# /bin/grep '^+:' /etc/shadow 
Remediation: 
Delete these entries if they exist. 
9.2.4 Verify No Legacy "+" Entries Exist in /etc/group File (Scored) 
Level 1 
Description: 
The character + in various files used to be markers for systems to insert data from NIS 
maps at a certain point in a system configuration file. These entries are no longer required 
on RHEL7 systems, but may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms. 
Rationale: 
These entries may provide an avenue for attackers to gain privileged access on the system. 
Audit: 
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned: 
# /bin/grep '^+:' /etc/group 
Remediation: 
Delete these entries if they exist. 
9.2.5 Verify No UID 0 Accounts Exist Other Than root (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system. 
Rationale: 
This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system 
console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved 
mechanism as noted in Item 7.5 Restrict root Login to System Console. 
Audit: 
Run the following command and verify that only the word "root" is returned: 
# /bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/awk -F: '($3 == 0) { print $1 }' 
root 
Delete any other entries that are displayed. 
9.2.6 Ensure root PATH Integrity (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The root user can execute any command on the system and could be fooled into executing 
programs unintentionally if the PATH is not set correctly. 
Rationale: 
Including the current working directory (.) or other writable directory in root's executable

9.2.7 Check Permissions on User Home Directories (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' home 
directories, the users can easily override these. 
Rationale: 
Group or world-writable user home directories may enable malicious users to steal or 
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd  | /bin/egrep -v '(root|halt|sync|shutdown)' |\ 
    /bin/awk -F: '($8 == "PS" && $7 != "/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do 
        dirperm=`/bin/ls -ld $dir | /bin/cut -f1 -d" "` 
        if [ `echo $dirperm | /bin/cut -c6 ` != "-" ]; then 
            echo "Group Write permission set on directory $dir" 
        fi 
        if [ `echo $dirperm | /bin/cut -c8 ` != "-" ]; then 
            echo "Other Read permission set on directory $dir"

            echo "Other Execute permission set on directory $dir" 
        fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Making global modifications to user home directories without alerting the user community 
can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a 
to be taken in accordance with site policy. 
9.2.8 Check User Dot File Permissions (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' "dot" files, the 
users can easily override these. 
Rationale: 
Group or world-writable user configuration files may enable malicious users to steal or 
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/egrep -v '(root|sync|halt|shutdown)' | 
/bin/awk -F: '($7 != "/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do 
    for file in $dir/.[A-Za-z0-9]*; do 
        if [ ! -h "$file" -a -f "$file" ]; then 
            fileperm=`/bin/ls -ld $file | /bin/cut -f1 -d" "` 
            if [ `echo $fileperm | /bin/cut -c6 ` != "-" ]; then 
                echo "Group Write permission set on file $file" 
            fi

                echo "Other Write permission set on file $file" 
            fi 
        fi 
    done 
done 
Remediation: 
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result 
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring 
policy be established to report user dot file permissions and determine the action to be 
taken in accordance with site policy. 
9.2.9 Check Permissions on User .netrc Files (Scored) 
Level 1 
Description: 
While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' .netrc files, 
the users can easily override these. 
Rationale: 
.netrc files may contain unencrypted passwords that may be used to attack other 
systems. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/egrep -v '(root|sync|halt|shutdown)' |\ 
    /bin/awk -F: '($7 != "/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do

                echo "Other Execute set on $file" 
            fi 
        fi 
    done 
done 
Remediation: 
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result 
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring 
taken in accordance with site policy. 
9.2.10 Check for Presence of User .rhosts Files (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
While no .rhosts files are shipped with RHEL7, users can easily create them. 
Rationale: 
This action is only meaningful if .rhosts support is permitted in the file /etc/pam.conf. 
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, they 
may have been brought over from other systems and could contain information useful to 
an attacker for those other systems. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash 
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/egrep -v '(root|halt|sync|shutdown)' |\ 
    /bin/awk -F: '($7 != "/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do 
    for file in $dir/.rhosts; do 
        if [ ! -h "$file" -a -f "$file" ]; then 
            echo ".rhosts file in $dir" 
        fi    done 
done 
Remediation: 
If any users have .rhosts files determine why they have them. 
9.2.11 Check Groups in /etc/passwd (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Over time, system administration errors and changes can lead to groups being defined in 
/etc/passwd but not in /etc/group. 
Rationale: 
system security since group permissions are not properly managed. 
Audit: 
Create a script as shown below and run it: 
#!/bin/bash 
for i in $(cut -s -d: -f4 /etc/passwd | sort -u ); do 
grep -q -P "^.*?:x:$i:" /etc/group 
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then 
echo "Group $i is referenced by /etc/passwd but does not exist in /etc/group" 
fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Analyze the output of the Audit step above and perform the appropriate action to correct 
any discrepancies found. 
9.2.12 Check That Users Are Assigned Valid Home Directories (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Users can be defined in /etc/passwd without a home directory or with a home directory 
does not actually exist. 
Rationale: 
If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/" 
and will not be able to write any files or have local environment variables set. 
Audit: 
This script checks to make sure that home directories assigned in the /etc/passwd file 
exist. 
#!/bin/bash  
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{ print $1 " " $3 " " $6 }' | while read user uid dir; do 
if [ $uid -ge 1000 -a ! -d "$dir" -a $user != "nfsnobody" ]; then 
echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user does not exist." 
fi 
done 
If any users' home directories do not exist, create them and make sure the respective user 
owns the directory.  Users without assigned should be removed or assigned a home 
directory as appropriate. 
9.2.13 Check User Home Directory Ownership (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The user home directory is space defined for the particular user to set local environment 
variables and to store personal files. 
Rationale: 
Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be 
the owner of the directory. 
Audit: 
This script checks to make sure users own the home directory they are assigned to in the 
/etc/passwd file. 
#!/bin/bash  
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{ print $1 " " $3 " " $6 }' | while read user uid dir; do 
if [ $uid -ge 1000 -a -d "$dir" -a $user != "nfsnobody" ]; then 
owner=$(stat -L -c "%U" "$dir") 
if [ "$owner" != "$user" ]; then 
echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user is owned by $owner." 
fi 
fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Change the ownership any home directories that are not owned by the defined user to the 
correct user. 
9.2.14 Check for Duplicate UIDs (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate User ID (UID), it is 
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the UID 
field. 
Rationale: 
Users must be assigned unique UIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate access 
protections. 
Audit: 
This script checks to make sure all UIDs in the /etc/passwd file are unique. 
#!/bin/bash  
echo "The Output for the Audit of Control 9.2.15 - Check for Duplicate UIDs is" 
/bin/cat /etc/passwd | /bin/cut -f3 -d":" | /bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/uniq -c |\ 
    while read x ; do 
    [ -z "${x}" ] && break 
    set - $x 
    if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then 
        users=`/bin/gawk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$2 \ 
            /etc/passwd | /usr/bin/xargs` 
        echo "Duplicate UID ($2): ${users}" 
    fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Based on the results of the script, establish unique UIDs and review all files owned by the 
shared UID to determine which UID they are supposed to belong to. 
9.2.15 Check for Duplicate GIDs (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate Group ID (GID), it is 
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file and change the GID 
field. 
Rationale: 
access protections. 
Note: In the case of extremely large groups it can become necessary to split a GID across 
group names due to character limits per line.  Any such instances should be carefully 
audited, unless absolutely necessary such instances should be avoided. 
Audit: 
This script checks to make sure all GIDs in the /etc/group file are unique. You can also use 
the /usr/sbin/grpck command to check for other inconsistencies in the /etc/group file. 
#!/bin/bash  
echo "The Output for the Audit of Control 9.2.16 - Check for Duplicate GIDs is" 
/bin/cat /etc/group | /bin/cut -f3 -d":" | /bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/uniq -c |\ 
    while read x ; do 
    [ -z "${x}" ] && break 
    set - $x 
    if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then 
        grps=`/bin/gawk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$2 \ 
            /etc/group | xargs` 
        echo "Duplicate GID ($2): ${grps}" 
    fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Based on the results of the script, establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by the 
shared GID to determine which group they are supposed to belong to. 
9.2.16 Check That Reserved UIDs Are Assigned to System Accounts 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Traditionally, UNIX systems establish "reserved" UIDs (0-999 range) that are intended for 
system accounts. 
Rationale: 
If a user is assigned a UID that is in the reserved range, even if it is not presently in use, 
security exposures can arise if a subsequently installed application uses the same UID. 
This script checks to make sure that "reserved" UIDs (0-499 range) are not assigned to 
non-system (default) accounts. 
#!/bin/bash  
defUsers="root bin daemon adm lp sync shutdown halt mail news uucp operator games 
gopher ftp nobody nscd vcsa rpc mailnull smmsp pcap ntp dbus avahi sshd rpcuser 
nfsnobody haldaemon avahi-autoipd distcache apache oprofile webalizer dovecot squid 
named xfs gdm sabayon usbmuxd rtkit abrt saslauth pulse postfix tcpdump" 
/bin/cat /etc/passwd |\ 
    /bin/awk -F: '($3 < 1000) { print $1" "$3 }' |\ 
    while read user uid; do 
        found=0 
        for tUser in ${defUsers} 
        do 
            if [ ${user} = ${tUser} ]; then 
                found=1 
            fi 
        done 
        if [ $found -eq 0 ]; then 
            echo "User $user has a reserved UID ($uid)." 
        fi 
    done 
Remediation: 
Based on the results of the script, change any UIDs that are in the reserved range to one 
that is in the user range. Review all files owned by the reserved UID to determine which 
UID they are supposed to belong to. 
9.2.17 Check for Duplicate User Names (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible 
for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the user name. 
Rationale: 
If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the 
first UID for that username in /etc/passwd. For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a 
subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000. 
Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem. 
This script checks to make sure all user names in the /etc/passwd file are unique. 
#!/bin/bash  
echo "The Output for the Audit of Control 9.2.18 - Check for Duplicate User Names is" 
cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d":" | /bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/uniq -c |\ 
    while read x ; do 
    [ -z "${x}" ] && break 
    set - $x 
    if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then 
        uids=`/bin/gawk -F: '($1 == n) { print $3 }' n=$2 \ 
            /etc/passwd | xargs` 
        echo "Duplicate User Name ($2): ${uids}" 
    fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Based on the results of the script, establish unique user names for the users. File 
ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs. 
9.2.18 Check for Duplicate Group Names (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate group name, it is 
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file and change the group 
name. 
Rationale: 
If a group is assigned a duplicate group name, it will create and have access to files with the 
first GID for that group in /etc/group. Effectively, the GID is shared, which is a security 
problem. 
Audit: 
This script checks to make sure all group names in the /etc/group file are unique. 
#!/bin/bash  
echo "The Output for the Audit of Control 9.2.19 - Check for Duplicate Group Names is" 
cat /etc/group | cut -f1 -d":" | /bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/uniq -c |\ 
    while read x ; do 
    set - $x 
    if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then 
        gids=`/bin/gawk -F: '($1 == n) { print $3 }' n=$2 \ 
            /etc/group | xargs` 
        echo "Duplicate Group Name ($2): ${gids}" 
    fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Based on the results of the script, establish unique names for the user groups. File group 
ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique GIDs. 
9.2.19 Check for Presence of User .netrc Files (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
Level 1 
Description: 
The .netrc file contains data for logging into a remote host for file transfers via FTP. 
Rationale: 
The .netrc file presents a significant security risk since it stores passwords in 
unencrypted form. Even if FTP is disabled, user accounts may have brought over .netrc 
files from other systems which could pose a risk to those systems. 
Audit: 
#!/bin/bash  
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd |\ 
    /bin/awk -F: '{ print $6 }'`; do 
    if [ ! -h "$dir/.netrc" -a -f "$dir/.netrc" ]; then 
        echo ".netrc file $dir/.netrc exists" 
    fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result 
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring 
policy be established to report user .netrc files and determine the action to be taken in 
accordance with site policy. 
9.2.20 Check for Presence of User .forward Files (Scored) 
Level 1 
Description: 
The .forward file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to. 
Rationale: 
Use of the .forward file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be inadvertently 
transferred outside the organization. The .forward file also poses a risk as it can be used 
to execute commands that may perform unintended actions. 
Audit: 
This script checks for the presence of .forward files that may be in violation of the site 
security policy. 
#!/bin/bash  
for dir in `/bin/cat /etc/passwd |\ 
/bin/awk -F: '{ print $6 }'`; do 
if [ ! -h "$dir/.forward" -a -f "$dir/.forward" ]; then 
echo ".forward file $dir/.forward exists" 
fi 
done 
Remediation: 
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result 
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring 
policy be established to report user .forward files and determine the action to be taken in 
accordance with site policy.
